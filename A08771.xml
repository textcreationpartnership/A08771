            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>diripietur poſſeſſio.</hi> In ſuch times wee doe liue (courteous Reader) as no care can be too much, no diligence too great, to preſerue that litle, which we haue, or are, from ruine, and rapine of the euill diſpoſed mighty. How intolerable the iniuries were, which ſome Prieſts once ſustained, and afterward freely forgaue, the whole world is now a witnes, and cannot but ſee, how vntimely theſe ſtirres were reuiued by the Ieſuits, and the <hi>Archpr.</hi> after that peace was concluded betweene them. Other iudges, then the whole world, the Priests would haue had, as appeareth by a letter of theirs to the <hi>Archpr.</hi> in their booke dedicated to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> pa. 61. but their humble petition was ſayd to be a tumultuous preſumption, and would not be heard. They foreſhewed what danger would grow by his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of a home-conference, but that did nothing mooue him. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they ſtood in ſuch tearmes for their good name, and fame, as they must either liue in perpetuall infamie, or vſe their pennes in their owne defence: the firſt no way fitting their calling, and preſent ſtate: the ſecond very dangerous to both parts: it being very probable, that an <hi>Apologie</hi> would draw on an Anſwere: the Anſwere, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: and that Reply not likely to be the last, howſoeuer lost labour. But neither could this perſwaſion purchaſe any peace, or procure, that the Controuerſie might be determined at home among themſelues. One way more did the Priests aſſay to ſtay the outrage of the Ieſuits and <hi>Archpr.</hi> and that was to ſend to the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the matters in queſtion, which was no ſooner ſeene by the <hi>Archpr.</hi> and Ieſuits, but an Edict made, <note place="margin">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5209:3"/> ſhould either directly or indirectly maintaine, or defend it in word, or in writing, <hi>whether it were truely giuen, or forged</hi> (marke I pray you this ſpirit) <hi>whether vpon true information, or otherwiſe, as being preiudiciall to the Sea Apoſtolike, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This headdie proceeding, and diſclaiming, or rather condemning all triall (but a ſelfe will, and a dangerous obſtinacie in the <hi>Archpr.</hi> and Ieſuits) compelled the Prieſts to aduiſe vpon ſome other courſe: in which conſult, they reſolued to appeale to the Sea Apoſtolike: and the better to preuent ſuch blockes, as were before layed in their way vpon the like attempt, they publiſhed certaine bookes: ſome in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſatisfie ſuch of our owne Countrey, as were miſinformed by the one part, and were not ſuffered to haue any ſpeech with the other: ſome in <hi>Latine,</hi> that the cauſe comming to triall, might not bee heard with that preiudice, which falſe informations had before wrought, and would not now be wanting.</p>
            <p>Againſt two of theſe bookes there is an <hi>Apologie</hi> lately come foorth, to wit, againſt the <hi>Latine</hi> booke which is dedicated to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and intituled: <hi>Declaratio motuum &amp;c.</hi> and againe an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh booke intituled, <hi>The Copies of certaine diſcourſes.</hi> And at the end of this <hi>Apologie</hi> there is an <hi>Appendix,</hi> wherein two other bookes are ſhrewdly threatned: the one in Engliſh, which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in reply to a letter of the <hi>Archprieſt,</hi> to his aſsiſtants, concerning the other bookes, and is intituled, <hi>The hope of peace:</hi> the other in <hi>Latine,</hi> which was dedicated to the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> and hath this title, <hi>Relatio compendioſa, &amp;c.</hi> It is a world to ſee what ſhifting there is in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> when a difficultie occurreth to bee anſwered: what iugling, to haue the matter on the Prieſtes ſide ſeeme odious: what haſte a ſecond vntrueth maketh to ouertake a former, which through the Authors fault onely had gotten the ſtart: how many rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten points there are, by which one ſtorie is made to hang vnder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: what ſingular deuotion, and extraordinary charity is expreſsed in the moſt vile, and bitter termes, that either malice, or madneſse could deuiſe: as, <note n="a" place="margin">The Epiſt. to his Hol.</note>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:5209:4"/> He will ſeeme to lament the courſe which is taken, and in the middeſt of his ſorow he ſheweth by one, or other impertinent ridiculous matter, how glad he is of any litle occaſion to ſport himſelfe at the griefes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. Yet notwithſtanding this ſo groſſe kind of dealing, as any man, who is not ouer-partiall, might enter into it, the applauſe of the ignorant (who will not either reade the bookes which the Prieſts ſet out, or examine what is boldly, although most vntruely, aduouched in this <hi>Apologie</hi>) demandeth an anſwere, which although M. <hi>Doctor Ely,</hi> and M. <hi>Iohn Collington</hi> haue largely and learnedly giuen to the moſt principall points therein handled, yet vpon the earneſt deſire of ſome, who haue ſeene this reply in my hands, I emboldened my ſelfe without the Authours priuitie to publiſh it, referring the Reader, for more ſatisfaction in this preſent controuerſie, vnto their labours.</p>
            <p>The laſt yeeres <hi>BREVE</hi> of the 17. of Auguſt would haue cast ſome doubt into me, whether I might haue attempted thus much, had not the <hi>Archpr.</hi> after a quarters meditation, or more thereon, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and immediatly after an <hi>Appendix</hi> vnto it. And if an vncontrolled cuſtome may haue the credite to be the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of a Lawe, my feare is much leſſened by the breaking out of another payre of bookes from the ſame Authours ſince that time: In which while they endeuour to manifest the bad ſpirits of other men, they diſcouer their owne, by ſuch tearmes, as ill beſeeme their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and pay doubly ſome one mans debt, to which they would falſely, and against their owne knowledge perſwade the Reader, that all the other Prieſtes were liable: and if no benefite riſe by this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Reader, yet will it be another (although a needleſse) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the wilfull blinde, whome the holy Ghoſt rebuketh by the Pſalmiſt in theſe wordes: <hi>Noluit intelligere vt bene ageret: He would not vnderſtand that thereby he might doe as hee ought to doe.</hi>

Some there are, who confeſſe, that their conſents were asked to the ſetting foorth of ſome booke in their names, the contents whereof they were not to know at that time: and of moſt likelyhood it was to the ſetting out of this book: but they denied to giue their conſents thereunto. Many ſuſpect that this <hi>Apologie</hi> was not written by thoſe Prieſts, which are here made to father it: but rather by thoſe, who haue alwayes made their commoditie by the diſunion of the Prieſts. And although it go forth in the name of many: it is very probable, that it was made by ſome one man. For whereas one man ſetting out a booke may vſe his phraſe in the plurall number, when he ſpeaketh of himſelfe: <hi>wee ſuppoſe:</hi> or, <hi>we ſay:</hi> it is ſeldome in vſe, that many ioyned together, do vſe in the like the ſinguler number: as <hi>I pray you: I ſuppoſe,</hi> which here we reade in the Preface <hi>I ſhall,</hi> in the firſt chapter: <hi>I thinke, I ſay,</hi> in the third Chapter: and in the ſixt chapter <hi>I omit.</hi>

Some other might doubt whether it were his doing, becauſe of the diuerſe Engliſhing of this ſentence: <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Obedite praepoſitis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, &amp; ſubiaccte eis:</hi> which here is thus Engliſhed: <hi>Obey your Superiours and ſubmit your ſelues vnto them.</hi> And in his ſelfe-clawing <hi>Wardword</hi> (wherein hee diſcouereth a piece of his diſpoſition againſt ſome Catholiques) he tranſlateth it thus: obey your Prelates and lie vnder them. Perchance thoſe who had the printing of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> prefixed this ſentence: and we will imagine, that they, in recompence of his extraordinarie commendations of them, requited him in that, which he might bluſh to ſay of himſelfe: if at any time his vndeſerued prayſes may make him bluſh. There is an other place of ſcripture ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the firſt to the Theſſ. cap. 5. <hi>Rogamus vos fratres, corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite inquietos.

               <p>It is very probable, that no ſuperiours dare auouch it: for it containeth the moſt groſſe vntrueths, &amp; idleſt ſhifts, and thoſe ſo hudling one vpon another (eſpecially where the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in queſtion is handled) that it is a very hard matter to find a trueth in it.

But to make this his cauill more plaine: the dignity of a legate had no ſpirituall liuing annexed vnto it: and yet did thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like princes hold him, to haue incurred the penaltie of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> who would exerciſe a power Legantine in England without the Soueraignes conſent: as may appeare by the anſwere of Card. <hi>Wolſey,</hi> when they endighted him in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> vpon thoſe ſtatutes, conſtrained thereunto (ſayth the hiſtory) to intitle the King to his goods and poſſeſſions. <note place="margin">Iohn Stow, 21.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5209:9"/> the Kings licenſe, and the King gaue it to him vnder his hand and broad Seale: which conuinceth, that whatſoeuer was the motiue of making thoſe ſtatutes, all prouiſions of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities from Rome were forbidden, and not thoſe onely which had temporall liuings annexed vnto them. And hereby alſo may it be ſeene, how ready theſe fellowes are to interprete o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens words in the worſt ſenſe, which they may, &amp; affirme moſt peremptorily, that the ſpeakers or writers had thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which it moſt pleaſed their aduerſaries to giue them. And thus much for this point. Onely this is to bee added, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this new <hi>manifeſter of ſpirits</hi> hath in this place recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſomewhat of his raſhneſſe, vttered in the <hi>Apol. cap. 2. fol. 15.</hi> concerning the chiefe purpoſe of thoſe ſtatutes of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> yet he hath left ſomewhat in this <hi>manifeſtation of ſpirits,</hi> which he muſt in ſome other place recant, or ſhew himſelfe a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate impoſtor: that is, concerning the time of the enacting thoſe Statutes, which were long before the time, in which hee here ſayth they were made, as may appeare by the booke of Statutes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſhift is as apparant, as this. For although many men in the world may ſay as much as the Archprieſt ſaid <hi>in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers caſes, wherein Appeale is cut off by his Holineſſe conſent and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> yet no man in the world, who profeſſeth to be a Catholike, will ſay it, and ſtand peremptorily in it, without ſome warrant by this clauſe in their Commiſſion, <hi>appellatione remota,</hi> or to that effect: which is not to be found in the Commiſſion which M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> had, as may appeare to thoſe, who will reade ouer the Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> his letters: by which he made him an <hi>Archpr</hi> and <hi>Superiour</hi> ouer the Seminary prieſts reſiding in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>

And if they had neuer gone, their ſending of this book to his Holines would iuſtifie as much, as is here ſet downe, by them: and if (notwithſtanding thoſe means which the prieſts did vſe) their <hi>appellation,</hi> and conſequently this booke, wherein the <hi>appellation</hi> is, neuer came to his Holines, it is made more euident, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the printing of theſe bookes was, that ſome one by one meanes or other, might by good chance light into his Holines hands.

Chap. there is a certaine remembrance of a letter of his to M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> which for ſo much of it, as is ſet downe in the ſecond Chapter, it condemneth the prieſts no more, then the Ieſuits: betweene whome belike hee had heard there was ſome priuate queſtions: of which, what his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, it is very well knowen to ſome, and hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by other: namely Doct. <hi>Haddocke,</hi> that the Card. before his death had ſuch diſguſt of the Ieſuites their actions, as this good Doctor being tolde by M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> what was reported in England to haue proceeded from a Ieſuite, tooke vpon him perchance to ſaue then the Ieſuites credit (for now they ſay hee denyeth it againe) that it was hee himſelfe who had vſed theſe words after the Cardinals death. <hi>He is well dead, for if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he had greatly diſhonoured himſelfe and his countrey.</hi>

               <p>In the 7. page, there is a <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe words: <hi>Deſudantibus, &amp;c. While Seminary Prieſts did ſweat in the harueſt of England, which harueſt was then well manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and almoſt ripe, ſome Ieſuits were called in by Doct. Allen to helpe them, &amp;c.</hi> But what are theſe <hi>falſhoods?</hi> and how are they proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Forſooth, <hi>for firſt</hi> (ſayth this good fellow) <hi>how well manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ripe the Engliſh Cath. harueſt was 22. yeeres agoe, when the Ieſuits were firſt ſent, there being then but few Prieſts in England, as hauing had but one onely Seminary vntill that time, and fewe knowen Catholikes, alſo in reſpect of the number, that after had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, this we ſay, is knowen to all men that vnderſtood our caſe.</hi>

               <p>We are not here to ſtand vpon the encreaſe of Catholikes, which hath beene within theſe 22. yeeres: for no doubt there haue bene more knowen, then were before. And if the Ieſuits will take it vpon them, that they haue beene greater encreaſers of Catholikes then the Secular prieſts, they will diſcouer in themſelues too much both falſhood and vanitie. And as for the exception which is taken againſt that which is ſaide of the <hi>good manuring of the harueſt in England,</hi> and that it was <hi>almoſt ripe before the Ieſuits came in,</hi> hee might as well haue taken excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prooued <hi>falſhood</hi> and vanity in our Sauiour his words, when he ſaid, <note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Lift vp your eyes, and behold the countrey, how ready it is now for harueſt.</hi> And this was ſpoken by Chriſt onely vpon the diſpoſition which he ſaw in the Samaritanes to receiue his doctrine. And as the number of Prieſts was not ſo great as now it is, ſo was it not ſo ſmall as this fellow would it ſhould be thought, and both the Prieſts and laity had ſuffered long before the Ieſuites ſet foot into England: and there was perchance more true &amp; ſincere religion in the leaſt houſhold, then now is in a wider compaſſe, what faire ſhewes ſoeuer are outwardly made to delude the world. And whereas it is here ſaid, that when the Ieſuits came into England, there was but one onely Seminary, it is as falſe as the other was fooliſh: For as it is ſet downe in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Apol. fol.</hi> 2. the firſt Engliſh Seminary began at <hi>Doway</hi> in the yere 1568. and neuer as yet failed, although vpon occaſion it hath beene tranſlated from thence into France, and backe againe now to <hi>Doway:</hi> ſo there is alſo mention in the ſame Chapter <hi>fol 3.</hi> of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Engliſh Colledge at Rome in the yeere 1578. which was before the Ieſuits entrance into England, as may be prooued out of the 12. Chapter of the ſame <hi>Apologie, fol. 181.</hi> where <hi>F. Parſons</hi> is ſaid to haue come into England betwixt Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Whitſontide in the yeere 1580. where he muſt needs heare of ſome prieſts, who had beene ſent from that Seminary before him. T.W. in his <hi>diſgreſsion from 16. Martyrs in one yere,</hi> pag. 52. ſayth, that the Colledge of Rome was founded in the yeere 1575. which was fiue yeeres before <hi>F.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5209:13"/> 
                  <hi>Parſons,</hi> and <hi>Fa Campion</hi> were the firſt Ieſuits, which were ſent into England to labour in that harueſt. As for thoſe generall letters, which follow in reproofe of theſe ſuppoſed falſhoods, they ſhalbe anſwered, where this Author ſetteth them downe in perticular.</p>
               <p>In the 8. page <hi>F. Heywood</hi> the Ieſuit is ſaid to bee falſly, and malitiouſly belied in theſe words: <hi>Oſtentansſe, &amp;c. A certaine Ieſuit vaunting himſelfe among our people, as though he had bene Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to the Sea Apoſtolicke, &amp;c.</hi> But you muſt go for proofe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the 3. chap. (where there is nothing to this purpoſe) and to the 11. chap. where <hi>fol. 164, F. Heywood</hi> is thus cleared from this pretended falſe, and malitious lye. <hi>Onely it is true, that ſome 16. or 17. Priests (whereof one chiefe man is ſaid to be of their faction at this day) met together with him,</hi> (that is F. Heywood) <hi>and would haue had all the Nationall customes of England about fasting (for ſome little diuerſitie, and difficulties, which they found in them) to be reduced to the common order of the Romane Church, which</hi> D. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, F. Parſons, M. Blackwell, <hi>and others did not allow: and</hi> F. Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood <hi>yeelded vnto theſe mens opinions.</hi> And thus much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſhould not haue bene ſaid here, had <hi>Fa. Parſons,</hi> and <hi>Fa. Heywood</hi> bene friends: but they being otherwiſe, and the good <hi>Fa. Heywood</hi> reclayming himſelfe, and ſeeking reformation of manythings in men of his order (for which cauſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his learning and other gifts, he was made to liue, and die very obſcurely) the Author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> is content to ſay ſomewhat of him in this caſe in queſtion: although ſo farre as it might touch the credit of the ſocietie, the blame is layed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Secular prieſtes. And becauſe perchance it is too well knowen, that ſome of thoſe prieſts (otherwiſe zealous men, as by their death they made euident remonſtrance) did long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breake thoſe faſts vpon the warrant of this Prouinciall Councell, it is ſaid that <hi>F. Heywood</hi> yeelded vnto the contrary opinion, leſt the ſocietie ſhould beare the diſcredit of ſo raſh an attempt. And thus is the calumniation anſwered, which was made againſt <hi>F. Heyw.</hi> and no otherwiſe, as the reader may ſee, if he will turne to the places whither this Author ſendeth him. And it cannot but argue great want of ſhame in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to run with ſuch fowle termes vpon men for ſaying that,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5209:14"/> which when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to ſalue, he knoweth not almoſt, how to deliuer otherwiſe with any likelyhood of trueth.</p>
               <p>In the 9 page the <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> is noted in theſe words: <hi>Parietiam modo, &amp;c. In like maner the Rectors of our Engliſh Romane Colledge did goe about many things, that were grieuous, and aſperous to our youthes.</hi> But for this point you muſt ſee it handled at large <hi>cap. 5. Apol.</hi> where alſo it is to be anſwered, or the Reader referred to ſome particuler treatiſe of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But in the ſame page, there is an other <hi>ſlander,</hi> that is: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectis, &amp;c. Card Allen, after he had conſidered, and diſcouered the endeauors of the Ieſuits, was wont to ſay, that they ſought more their owne good then either that of our Countrey, or Colledge.</hi> The proofe here of muſt now ſtand vpon the honeſty of the Relators: but how iuſtly he, or any other might ſpeake it, I refer me to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different mans iudgement, when the Ieſuits would neuer ſuffer any to be in reſt in the College, who would not ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be drawne to the ſocietie either by them, or their Agents, who liuing in the Colledge, as the other ſtudents did, had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vowes to be Ieſuits, and perſwaded, as many as they could, to take the ſame courſe. And England hauing more need to be furniſhed with ſuch, as were moſt fit to take vpon them the care of ſoules, who can doubt whether the Ieſuits in ſeeking the moſt towardly youthes to leaue their vocation, and become of their order, <hi>ſought more their owne good, then either that of our Countrey, or Colledge?</hi> And to the queſtion here fooliſhly propoſed, <hi>what priuate good can the Ieſuits pretend for themſelues worth their labors, and perils in England, more then in the Indies, except the good of ſoules, and ſeruice of God?</hi> As though they ſought ſomewhat els in the Indies, then the good of ſoules, and ſeruice of God, or at the leaſt not ſo much, as in England; We anſwere both according to their proceedings, and <hi>F. Parſons</hi> platforme of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> that whatſoeuer they pretend, they ſeeke to keepe not onely the Secular prieſts in a ſeruile ſubiection vnto them, but the Biſhops alſo, and all the whole State of England: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing already in their platforme or <hi>Councell of Reformation</hi> ſet downe all Eccleſiaſticall men, as penſioners, at the diſcretion of ſome Ieſuits, and ſome Secular prieſts, no doubt of their chooſing, for auoyding of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, &amp; diuiſion. And whereas
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5209:14"/> (good man) he talketh of the Ieſuits <hi>labours, and perils</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who knoweth not, how deliciouſly they fare, how gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly they are attired, how quietly they ſleepe in the beſt, and ſafeſt houſes in England? inſomuch as it is a marueilous won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when any Ieſuit is in perill. And there hath not wanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lay gentlemen, that for theſe reſpects haue wiſhed themſelues Ieſuits, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they haue liued with wife, children, great friends, and as great contentment, as this world can yeeld to wealthy protected Catholicks.</p>
               <p>In the 11. page is this falſhood noted or ſlander againſt <hi>Card.

At that time both the Colledge, and al the ſchollers had bene vndone, if Car.

               <p>In the 12. page this Author hath noted great falſhood in the narration of the ſtirres of <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and telleth his Reader in his religious termes, how the prieſts doe <hi>calumniate</hi> Weſton, <hi>and the bigger and better part, becauſe they liued in order, and retired themſelues from theſe mens licentiouſnes,</hi> and for more proofe hereof his reader muſt goe looke in the 6. chapter of the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> where hee is like to finde many vntrueths vttered by his Author, which are already diſcouered in a relation ſet out of thoſe matters.</p>
               <p>In the 15. page (which hee calleth the 13.) hee noteth this <hi>falſhood,</hi> that the prieſts called themſelues <hi>vnited: Laicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. The Ieſuits did alienate Lay mens mindes</hi> ab vnitis ſacerdotibus, <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnited prieſts: note</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the phraſe of vnited, they being farre the leſſe number, and diuided both from their head, and the reſt of their body the Engliſh Clergie. It is as the Hollanders doe call their rebelled ſtates againſt the King,</hi> The vnited Prouinces, &amp;c. Note, ſay I, how this felow abuſeth his reader, by tellinghim of a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt <hi>a head,</hi> where there was none, but <hi>voto</hi> only, that is to ſay, by a religious deſire, which was in <hi>Fa. Weston</hi> the Ieſuite, who would be directer of all the prieſts in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> to which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5209:15"/> becauſe ſome would not conſent, he and his company diuided themſelues from them, which being an vniuſt, and a ſcandalous ſeparation, the other prieſts, who remained in their former courſe of life, might iuſtly call themſelues <hi>vnited,</hi> as men, who properly kept the <hi>vnion,</hi> when the other made ſuch a diuiſion as they would not haue any commerce with them, vpon their idle toy of <hi>Reformation,</hi> vnder pretence whereof the Ieſuits ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten the ſuperiority, the prieſts muſt yeeld to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they would offer, or the whole countrey muſt be in an vprore: yet will theſe men chalenge the name of <hi>vnited.</hi> But let euery indifferent man iudge, which part did moſt liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a rebellious ſtate. And for the further proofe of this fellow his malicious impoſtures (for it is not poſſible that hee ſhould haue hereof any ignorance) let any indifferent reader looke vpon that diſcourſe cited here by him out of the Latine booke, and it will bee as cleere as noone day, that there is no mention of any other matter, then of the diuiſion wrought at <hi>Wisbich</hi> by the Ieſuites and their faction, ſome yeeres before the Archprieſt was inſtituted, and conſequently before there was any other head or whole body of the Engliſh Clergie, then that, from which the Ieſuits and their factious adherents diuided themſelues.</p>
               <p>In the 16. page this Author diſcouereth another <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Ticonius ille Donatiſta,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That Ticonius the Donatiſt, &amp;c. Note</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſpirit of theſe men, they compare al the good, and quiet priſoners in</hi> Wisbich <hi>Donatiſts, for that they retired themſelues from theſe mens tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſcandalous life, and put themſelues vnder rule. See cap 6. Apolog.</hi> Are not theſe wordes, <hi>Ticonius ille Donatista,</hi> ſhrewd wordes, that doe inferre ſuch large conſequences? are not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe tumultuous, and ſcandalous termes, and irreligious exceptions againſt the life of Catholike prieſts, and ſome of them long priſoners for the Catholike faith, an euident proofe of moſt looſe and large conſciences? But to make this matter more plaine againſt this impoſtor, what if there were no ſpeech of any of the Prieſts? What a malicious Comment is this vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe three words, <hi>Ticonius ille Donatiſta, That Ticonius the Donatiſt.</hi> Is it not moſt euident that the ſpeech there vſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5209:15"/> no one, or other more then <hi>Fa. Weſton</hi> the Ieſuit? But yet this was too much to compare him to a <hi>Donatist.</hi> Well, but then what if neither he were compared to a <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, what if in that very place <hi>F. Weſton</hi> is ſhewed not to be <hi>Ticonius the Donatiſt,</hi> or a follower of him? how then can the indifferent Reader, but iudge the Author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> paſt ſhame, who will lay it to the Prieſts charge, that in this place cited, <hi>they compare all the good, and quiet priſoners in Wisbich to Donatiſts?</hi> And for what cauſe? Forſooth, <hi>for that they retired themſelues from theſe mens tumultuous, and ſcandalous life, and put themſelues vnder rule.</hi> Let vs therefore now ſee what there is in that 16. page concerning <hi>Ticonius ille Donatiſta: That Tico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the Donatiſt, &amp;c.</hi> Thus we reade in that 16. page. <hi>Tandem verò aliquando, vt inuidiam leniret, quam ſibi, ſuis<expan>

               <p>In the 20 page there is exception taken againſt that which is mentioned of <hi>F. Weſton</hi> his being taken dumbe, and falling downe: and it is called an <hi>impudent fiction, refuted by authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call teſtimonies of all the quiet priſoners in Wisbich:</hi> and you muſt goe looke for this in the 6. Chapter of the <hi>Apol.</hi> where you may find it contrary if you can. For anſwere to this, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Reader to the particular narration of the ſtirres in <hi>Wisbich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 21. page the <hi>principall dece it, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5209:17"/> in theſe wores, <hi>Conſilium iniuimus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We tooke a counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for appointing prouoſts and ſuperiors ouer vs in opportune places of the kingdome &amp;c.</hi> It was death for this good fellow to go any further in the narration, which here he doth calumniate: for if he had added theſe words (which are part of the ſentence ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him with an &amp;c. <hi>all which Prouoſts and ſuperiours ſhould haue bene choſen by the free ſuffrages of the Prieſts,</hi> his falſhood would haue bene diſcouered, which he ſheweth here in theſe words. <hi>This was the worke of their</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>aſſociation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a few buſie and ambitious men tooke vpon them to be Counſellors of State without Commiſsion, or conſent of the reſt of the Clergie, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their ſuperiours, to appoint dignities to themſelues, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at their pleaſures, and to make a new ſedition.</hi> And if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will vouchſafe to turne to that 21. page, hee ſhall ſee that this author is little to bee credited in his relations, and may wonder, that he will ſo ſhameleſly behaue himſelfe, as euery indifferent man muſt condemne him of exceeding great falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and direct intention to deceiue his reader. And becauſe he referreth his reader to the letters of the aſſiſtants, and other proofes, <hi>cap. 8. &amp; 9.</hi> there we will make our anſwere vnto them for ſo much as is there touched in this matter.</p>
               <p>In the 23. page theſe words are cited, <hi>Quid interea P. Parſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c. What did F. Parſons in this meane ſpace, the Author, incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and actor of allour perturbations, &amp;c.</hi> But nothing being in this place anſwered to that which in the 23. page is ſayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, we are not to ſtand vpon thoſe other matters which are here mentioned. It ſufficeth that there is nothing conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of <hi>deceit, falſhood, or ſlander:</hi> to which ende the table maker brought this place out of the latine booke.</p>
               <p>In the 26. page M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> is ſaid to be ſlandered, and that theſe were ſpiteful ſpeeches againſt him: <hi>Videns autem D. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, &amp;c. M. Blackwell ſeeing this, &amp;c.</hi> where in the Latine booke mention is made of a letter he writ to the Card <hi>Caietane:</hi> the letter is out in print, and whoſoeuer wil take the paines to read it ſhall ſee, that there is nothing but the truth ſet downe in the place here cited by this authour. And whereas here it is vrged, that he is named euery where without any reuerence at al, they will hardly ſince him named, but Maſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> which is as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5209:17"/> much reuerence as is due vnto him for any thing the Prieſtes know. And if he be ſometime called <hi>the Archprieſt,</hi> it is as much as this Authour giueth him, as may be ſeene in many places. Moreouer, if there be any thing to the contrary in the 4, 10, or 11. chap. of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> it ſhall be there anſwered.</p>
               <p>In the 27. page, a <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander</hi> is noted, where it is ſaid: <hi>Cum omnes, &amp;c. Whereas all Ieſuits almoſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland be children of poore parents, &amp;c.</hi> And to this, what anſwer is here made? Forſooth <hi>how manifeſtly falſe and ſhameleſse this is, there needes no other proofe but to know the parties: and to conſider alſo, what manner of children, and of what parents they be that doe obiect this, &amp;c.</hi> But alas (good man) were they much worſe then they are, who are ſaide to obiect this, they are by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees his betters, who is taken to be the Author of this <hi>Apologie.</hi> And if the prieſts had as impertinently ſpoken ſo of the Ieſuits, as this good fellow ſpeaketh of the prieſts, his folly might haue bene in ſome ſort excuſed: but it being euident, that this fellow his ſpeech proceedeth of ſplene, and without either any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to inlarge himſelfe ſo farre, or any furtherance to his cauſe, (for what doth the quality of this or that man, make better or worſe the qualitie of another?) the place noted in this 27. pag. doth ſhew a iuſt cauſe, why the prieſts did ſay the trueth in that cauſe. For whereas M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> (to the ignominie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike gentlemen) did moſt vngratefully ſuggeſt, and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely to the Card. <hi>Caietane,</hi> that the Ieſuits did marueils in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in the releeuing of all ſorts of people diſtreſſed, and that they did it <hi>out of their owne patrimonies,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, not worth the ſpeaking of, which they receiued of almes from the Catholikes:</hi> the prieſts, to ſhew how palpable this flattery was, affirmed (as they might iuſtly) that <hi>all the Ieſuites almoſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland were children of poore parents:</hi> and conſequently not like to doe ſo much, &amp; in that ſort, as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> did moſt groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſt. And let this be ſufficient for this time vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to prooue that it is no <hi>calumniation,</hi> as the margent would haue the reader to thinke it, nor <hi>deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> as this table is entituled.</p>
               <p>In the 29. page are diuers things noted, as that <hi>Pope</hi> Xiſtus <hi>was tearmed a Wolfe by the Ieſuites, and defamed as a most wicked
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5209:18"/> man,</hi> and certaine propoſitions maintained about the Stewes, which will be iuſtified to haue beene vttered by F. <hi>Weſton</hi> the Ieſuite in defence of M. <hi>Archer</hi> one of his principal confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in his faction at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and generally taken for a Ieſuite, and cannot therefore but appertaine to the Ieſuits, betweene whomeſoeuer the controuerſie firſt began.</p>
               <p>In the 30. page the prieſtes are ſaide to call the authoritie of their ſuperior, inſtituted by Chriſts vicar, <hi>Laruam:</hi> that is, <hi>a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vizard:</hi> which is very falſe; and no modeſt man would haue auowched it out of that place, it ſounding no otherwiſe, then thus: <hi>ad dominium comporandum alienae perſonae larua vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum putabant:</hi> that is, <hi>they</hi> (the Ieſuits) <hi>to get dominion, thought they muſt vſe a maske of an other perſon;</hi> which can beare no other ſence then this: that they would rule, and an other ſhould beare the name: and if ought were done amiſſe, it ſhould neuer bee knowen who were the actors. But this man muſt be ſeene in it: and they muſt be couered by him: which euery man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be a very ordinary courſe in the world, &amp; cry out ſhame vpon it, without any touch to authority, but to the abuſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And whereas <hi>Fa. Parſons memorials</hi> are here ſaid to bee yet extant, intrearing for obteyning of Biſhops, it is no diſproofe to that, which is auowched by the prieſts: it being ſo poſſible for the ſame man to vrge mightily the very ſame matter, which he will, by ſome meanes, or other, croſſe. And there is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofe of this kind of dealing in <hi>F. Parſons:</hi> as for example. At the parting of ſome ſtudents from Rome, hee writ a letter of commendations in the behalfe of one of them, and at the very ſame time hee writ aſmuch to the contrary to the very ſame place: inſomuch as they to whom thoſe letters came, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them together, could not but maruaile much at this falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in him. Likewiſe when M.D. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was to depart from Rome to Paris, in the way of great friendſhip and confidence, <hi>F. Parſons</hi> requeſteth him, that there might be intercourſe of letters betweene them: Mary one thing aboue the reſt he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto him: and that was, to certifie him from time to time of M.D. <hi>Cecill</hi> his carriage, and at the ſame time he writ to M. D. <hi>Cecill</hi> to doe him the like fauour for M.D <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And not long after he ſollicited M. <hi>Shelborne</hi> (a reuerend prieſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5209:18"/> then abiding in Paris) to certifie him againſt them both: and very likely it was, there was ſome other appointed to pay his debts. But imagine what ſport there was when theſe letters came forth: and how peeuiſh they are, who will not beleeue that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> can play all maner of playes for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the 33. page the <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander</hi> is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of thoſe wordes, <hi>Nullo &amp;c. no reſpest being had to the moſt Catholike Archb. of</hi> Glaſco. I would aske this good fellow what reſpect was had vnto this Biſhop, when the Archprieſt was made ſuperior without his priuitie or conſent ouer all the Engliſh prieſts which then were, or after ſhould be reſident in his dioceſſe? And if there were no reſpect had vnto him, what <hi>deceit, falſhood or ſlander</hi> was there in ſaying ſo? But liſten I pray you to the conceit which is made hereupon. <hi>See</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſtrange deſire of theſe men to ſet ſtrife euery where. They would ſtirre vp the Archb. of</hi> Glaſco <hi>reſiding in Paris for aboue 30. yeres againſt the Protector: for that he giueth iuriſdiction to the Archpriest vpon Engliſh Prieſts in England, Scotland and Ireland, and yet theſe men do aske faculties for theſe three countries, but would be vnder no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in any.</hi> Now alas (good man) where hath he his ground concerning this laſt point, that <hi>the prieſts would not be vnder au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie?</hi> ſo often as hee doeth vrge the aſſociation intended in England by the Prieſts, hee conuinceth himſelfe of this falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: And if he were ſet to finde, where the Prieſts asked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for thoſe three countries as ſuperiors there, he would be ſorely troubled. But the Reader muſt take all this vpon his word: as alſo that the Prieſts minded to ſet the <hi>Protector,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Glaſco</hi> together by the eares, when they ſaid that in the inſtitution of this authoritie ouer all the Engliſh prieſts in Scotland, there was no reſpect had to the Catholick Biſhop of <hi>Glaſco.</hi> How much better might it be ſaid that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> and his confederats ment to ſet ſtrife betweene them, when ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly they procured the <hi>Protector</hi> to giue ſuch iuriſdiction to a ſtrange Archprieſt within the dioces of a Biſhop in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation, and no way ſubiect to any prelate of England? In this fooliſh fury alſo, how forgetteth he that he often ſaith that the Cardin all did but witnes the authoritie by his letters, and ſetteth it downe in plaine termes, <hi>that the Priest would ſtirre vp
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5209:19"/> the Biſhop against the</hi> Protector, <hi>for that he giueth iuriſdiction to the Archpriest?</hi> In the <hi>Apologie</hi> almoſt in euery place, it is ſaid that there was in the Prieſts at the firſt comming of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters no leſſe, then a reſiſtance againſt the Popes order; and how then was not the danger of ſtirring vp the Biſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Holines, but againſt the <hi>Protector?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 35. page and ſo forward to the 59. many things are noted, for which the Reader muſt goe looke in the <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 61. page <hi>a principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander</hi> is noted in theſe words. <hi>His viſis, &amp;c. As ſoone as we ſaw the Apoſtolicall letters of the new</hi> Breue <hi>for confirmation of the Archprieſt; we all preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted our ſelues &amp;c.</hi> This is ſo manifeſt and ſo often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all from the higheſt to the loweſt, as there ſhal neede no further iuſtifying thereof: But this author would haue his reader conceiue that this ſubmiſſion was <hi>fained and forced, and that the euent ſhewed ſo much: and that it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the Prieſts hauing entred with the Counſell ſo farre, as they had done, as is ſhewed Cap. 10. &amp; 13. where</hi> (ſaith this fellow) <hi>wee ſhew, by their owne letters, their conſpiracie with the perſecutor.</hi> But in concluſion if you doe not truſt him vpon his wordes more, then vpon his proofes which he bringeth either in the 10 or 13 Chap. you muſt hold him ſtill for ſuch as he is. We haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayd enough hereof in the defence of that, which hee commenteth vpon thoſe words, <hi>Hinc à communi &amp;c.</hi> p. 2. as he hath cited it in the beginning of this his table of deceits, to which we remit you for this time; and omitting that which here he ſaith, that the ſubmiſſion of the prieſts was <hi>forced:</hi> which implyeth a true ſubmiſſion (nothing being inforced, but their wil to accept of him againſt whom they had many iuſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) I will onely note how falſly, and deceitfully this good felow vſeth this place, which thus he hath cited, out of the 61. page. <hi>His viſis &amp;c. As ſoone as we ſaw the Apoſtolical letters of the new Breue, &amp;c.</hi> what can his reader thinke of theſe words, <hi>the new Breue;</hi> but that there was ſom former <hi>Breue,</hi> which was not obeyed by the prieſts? And to this purpoſe, as in other places, ſo in his firſt Chap. of his <hi>Apol. fol. 8.</hi> he vſeth the ſame deceit, <hi>He</hi> (the Pope) <hi>confirmed all that was done already by the Card. with a new Breue:</hi> where alſo in the margent this note is made, <hi>A new
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5209:19"/> Breue 1599.</hi> leſt any man ſhould thinke it a worde ſpoken by chance, and not of purpoſe, and it is the more apparant in this place, which now we handle, becauſe he hath falſly tranſlated the prieſts words, and made them to talke of <hi>a new Breue.</hi> For thus he alleageth them. <hi>His viſis &amp;c. As ſoone as we ſaw the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall letters of the</hi> new Breue <hi>for confirmation of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, we all preſently ſubmitted our ſelues to him:</hi> where <hi>His viſis,</hi> that is, <hi>theſe being ſeene,</hi> is onely referred to theſe words, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitatis tuae literae:</hi> that is, <hi>the letters of your Holines:</hi> And there is no other mention, of any other <hi>Apoſtolicall letters,</hi> or any other <hi>Breue,</hi> much leſſe any <hi>Apoſtolicall letters of a new Breue,</hi> as it may be ſeene by them, who will turne to the place.</p>
               <p>In the 69. page <hi>a principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of thoſe words, <hi>Archipresbyter, &amp;c. The Archprieſt denieth acceſſe vnto him, he will not be ſeene, he doth diſdaine to talke with his brethren, &amp;c.</hi> But how is this proued <hi>deceit, falſhood, or ſlander?</hi> Forſooth thus. <hi>All things are rhethorically exaggerated, yet it is no maruaile though the Archprieſt do vſe ſome moderation, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in admitting thoſe men to ſpeach, whom hee knoweth to haue an euill mind towards him, and to deale with the Councel, and Biſhop of London, and to ſeeke his ſpeech onely to braule, and to take ſome aduantage at his words: as two of them did, who accuſed him of an hereticall propoſition in talking with him preſently vpon the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of his firſt commiſsion.</hi> Had this fellow onely giuen a cauſe, why the Archprieſt would not talke with the prieſts, without any more adoe, it had been a little ſigne of ſome ſmall grace in him: but to bring that in for a <hi>deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> which he cannot denie, but muſt confeſſe to be true, and ſtraineth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to giue a cauſe thereof, it is too ſhamefull. It being then euident, that the Archprieſt will not ſpeake with the prieſts, let vs ſee how good theſe cauſes are, and how true, which are here alleaged. The firſt is, <hi>becauſe hee knoweth that the Prieſtes haue an euill mind towards him:</hi> but this ſauoureth too much of malice. The ſecond is, <hi>he knoweth that they deale with the Councel and Biſhop of London:</hi> but alas this cauſe commeth too late, as may appeare by comparing the times together in which the Archp. hath denied to ſpeak with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the times in which it hath pleaſed the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel as he ſuppoſeth to ſhew them ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5209:20"/> fauour by meanes of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> hauing conceiued ſome hope of their loyaltie towards their prince and country.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe here alledged is, for that <hi>the Archprieſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, they ſeeke his ſpeech, onely to brawle and to take ſome aduantage at his words, as two of them did, &amp;c.</hi> and in the margent M. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> and M. <hi>Charnock</hi> are named. It is very likely, if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt would be ſo reſolute, as he would agree to no reaſon, but run on the courſe he hath begun, the prieſts might haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as litle edified as M. <hi>Collington</hi> and <hi>M. Charnock</hi> did, when he ſent for them &amp; M <hi>Heburne</hi> to ſpeake with them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon the arriual of his firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, that is, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals letters vnto him, or <hi>conuented</hi> them, as M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> gaue it out in the <hi>Clinke</hi> not long after, whereupon M. <hi>H Henſlow,</hi> who before was taken for the Archpr. <hi>meſſenger,</hi> was called his <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and was very angry at it. And this particuler is brought that it may appeare, what a bold face that fellow hath, who in the <hi>Appendix fol.</hi> 7. affirmeth, <hi>that it ſeemeth they</hi> (M. <hi>Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi>) <hi>were ſent to him of purpoſe to catch him in his words.</hi> And if where difference is, there muſt of neceſſity be brawling, I thinke no man doubteth, but he is the brawler who offereth the iniury, not he who vſeth neceſſarie defence. And if moreouer M. <hi>Collington</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> haue accuſed the Archp. of an heretical propoſition (as this Author in this place inſinuateth) I do verely perſwade my ſelfe, that they will proue it ſo farre foorth as two men of their qualitie may prooue it, which would be little for M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> credit, notwithſtanding the ſlight reckoning which is made of <hi>their two relations onely, Cap 8 fol. 109.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 83. page a <hi>principall deceit, falſhood, or ſlander,</hi> is noted in theſe words, <hi>Plura, &amp;c. The Ieſuits doe bragge, that many more Seminaries haue beene erected by them, &amp;c.</hi> The Prieſts words are theſe: <hi>Plura numero,</hi> more in number. <hi>This is very calumnious</hi> (ſaith this good felow) <hi>but if they ſhould ſpeake of any ſuch matter compelled by your ſlanders, ſhould they not ſay truth, ſeeing fiue or fixe partly Seminaries, partly reſidences, haue beene erected by them? &amp;c.</hi> Well good ſir, not to deuine here what ſlanders they were, which ſo happily compelled the Ieſuites to ſpeake of their ſo great benefits vnto the prieſts, I will keepe mine eye-ſight for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5209:20"/> the 3, 5, 10, and 12. chap. where I am told, I ſhall ſee more of this moſt inſolent ingratitude: And in the meane while I will hope that the Ieſuits of their charitie, will forgiue them all, who compelled them to ſpeake ſo much of their owne great good deeds, which, were they a thouſand times more then they are, the Ieſuites ought not to embolden themſelues, or challenge thereby a greater libertie to abuſe men at their pleaſure: and it is a ſilly proofe, that they haue not abuſed men in one kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they haue done them a good turne in another. And with this the table was taken vp: for the author had no other meaning when he ſet you to this table of <hi>principall deceits, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and ſlanders,</hi> then to let you haue a taſte of thoſe two libels, which the diſcontented prieſts did ſet forth, to wit, the booke dedicated to his Holines, entituled, <hi>Declaratio motuum, A decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſtirres, &amp;c.</hi> and the Engliſh booke entituled, <hi>The Copies of certaine diſcourſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas (poore man) either his wits appeare hereby to be very ſhallow, who out of an infinite heape of ſlanders, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations, and contumelious ſpeeches, which hee ſayth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the prieſts bookes, could no better furniſh his table with <hi>deceits, falſhoods, and ſlanders,</hi> which here hee vndertooke: or his malice extreame great, to make ſuch a vaineglorious ſhew, where the principal ſtuffe was of no more moment, then is already ſhewed in theſe 28. pickt points, to diſcredit the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> booke and the authors thereof, who alwayes haue, &amp; will ſhew, that they meane better then hee doth, and tend to that place to which honeſt prieſts ſhould tend, and hope to arriue in the end: whence it is to be feared, they ſhall behold the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this <hi>Apologie</hi> lying, and too late repenting this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his miſdeeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reſt that followeth in this</hi> Latine <hi>booke about the Appellation</hi> (ſayth this Author) <hi>as alſo about a fond and ſeditious</hi> Latine <hi>letter of</hi> M.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5209:21"/> ſake put off to the 1, 2, 7, and 11. <hi>Apol.</hi> where it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, not to haue any thing in it worthy the name of a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, but to a Phariſie: and thereby it will be ſhewed to bee a worke, fit for Catholike prieſts to write, and publiſh to the world, their caſe ſtanding as then it did. And their fact will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more iuſtifiable, by how much it will appeare by the anſwer to this <hi>Apologie,</hi> that they cannot be diſprooued, but by manifeſt <hi>falſhoods, deceits, and ſlanders.</hi> After theſe notes, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt the <hi>Latine</hi> booke, which was dedicated to his Holines vnder this title, <hi>Declaratio motuum, &amp;c.</hi> march certaine principall perſons, which the Reader muſt beleeue, are iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prieſts, and are defended by the <hi>Apologie:</hi> amongſt which there are ſuch placed, as the Authors might with more honeſtie haue made two liſts: one, of thoſe moſt honourable perſonages; the other, of the reſt: but ſince that they haue put them all in one companie, one anſwere ſhal ſerue to the whole liſt: that howſoeuer his Holines is here abuſed in the Epiſtle, and the honour of the honourable is touched in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> the prieſts at no time haue iniuried either them, or any the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>by-hangers:</hi> neither can the contrary be ſhewed, as any man (who knoweth what vſe this author will make of a little) may iuſtly imagine, in that there is no one place cited out of the booke written by the prieſts, or in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> where any abuſe is conuinced. And although ſometimes in this <hi>Apologie</hi> the author putteth his reader in mind of ſuch matters, he doth diſcouer nothing, but his owne deſires in ſome, and follie in other his exceptions, as ſhall be ſhewed when occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And in the meane while, the diſcreete reader may iudge, whether this authour or publiſher were not paſt ſhame, who could not but know, that the prieſts had bene with the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in Flanders, and acknowledged his authoritie. And to that end, that no principall thing be hidden from his reader, he hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>principall deceits,</hi> and principall perſons, ſet down the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall authors &amp; ſpreaders of the bookes, wherein theſe <hi>principall deceits</hi> are contained, &amp; the principall perſons iniuried. And in naming thoſe which he doth name for the principall authors, he hath committed a very groſſe error in his Preface, where he ſeemeth to doubt who were the authors. And in the end he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5209:21"/> thus, <hi>So as theſe bookes muſt needs be preſumed, to haue bene publiſhed either by ſome one, or few diſcompoſed paſsionate people, or by ſome heretike or other enemie, to diſhonour them all; and diſcredit our cauſe, and nation: and ſo as to ſuch we ſhall anſwer, &amp;c.</hi> what man of iudgement will not ſay, that either the memorie of this fellow is very ſhort, or his honeſtie very ſmall, who hauing named, whom he thinketh to be the authors, maketh his anſwere, <hi>as to heretikes?</hi> And if to theſe be added thoſe diſgraceful ſpeeches, which are vſed in the beginning of the 3. Chap. fol. 20. againſt the Authors of the bookes, impugned by the Apologie, his moſt audacious friendes will bluſh at his folly, for there very contemptuouſly he affirmeth, that <hi>ſome of them went ouer poore ſeruing men, other ſouldiers,</hi> (what an ingratitude, and diſhonor is this to <hi>Fa. Ignatius Laiola,</hi> the ſouldier, and Ieſuites founder?) <hi>other wanderers in the world, &amp;c.</hi> Poſſibly this good mans wits are not alwaies at home, and they ſhould doe him great iniury, who ſhould looke for one wiſe worde from him, which is not put into him by ſome other. If he had not named thoſe ſixe for the principall authors of the books, he might with leſſe ſhame haue vttered his foule conceite: but hauing named them, hee cannot auoide the note of a moſt malitious falſe companion, what godly pretences and promiſes ſoeuer he maketh of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in this <hi>Apologie.</hi>

His Holines is here put in minde of ſuch ſtrange matters, and his wiſedome very highly commended vpon ſo falſe grounds, as if this Epiſtle had bene euer deliuered vnto him, hee would ſpeedily haue diſcouered a notable ſycophancy. He is here told of two principall motiues, for his ordaining our <hi>eaſie, and ſweet ſubordination.</hi> The one were certaine letters, which ſignified, that betweene the <hi>tumultuous</hi> who departed into England in the yeere 1597, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Societie,</hi> there was not that peace, which he had commanded, but <hi>new meanes rather deuiſed of further diuiſion, and ſedition.</hi> The other were other <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and requests of diuers of the grauest prieſts of our nation, which after</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wee ſhall cite.</hi> Concerning the firſt, leaſt there ſhould be any error in Iudgement, what thoſe new meanes of further diuiſion ſhould be, there is this note in the margent, <hi>The new aſsociation;</hi> which conceite is deliuered in plainer termes, and more at large in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Apol. fol.</hi> 6. in this maner, <hi>But the reliques of thoſe, that had bene troubleſome, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet before their comming into England, and conferring againe with their conſorts of their former actions, and deſignments, fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as they thought) by</hi> F.

Chapter <hi>fol. 13 his Holines hearing of certaine</hi> new Aſſociations <hi>begun in England ſoone after the tumults ended in Rome, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe (to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5209:23"/> omit other places in the <hi>Apologie</hi>) are ſufficient to ſhew, that his intention is, to make the Pope beleeue, that the <hi>Aſsociation</hi> which was begun in England by the Secular prieſts, was a new deuiſe of thoſe, who were ſent from Rome in the yeere <hi>1597,</hi> as <hi>tumultuous,</hi> and vnquiet perſons. That this is a meere deluding of his Holines, all who were then in England can very well te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie: yea <hi>F. Parſons</hi> himſelfe will doe vs the fauour (I am ſure) to ſay this is a very falſe tale, who vnderſtood at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Rome by M. <hi>Iames Standiſh,</hi> that ſuch an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> had bene long before intended, and conſequently could not bee a deuice of ſuch, as thought themſelues fruſtrated of their deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by his dealing in Rome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>6.</hi> aſſiſtants in their letters of the 2. of <hi>May 1601.</hi> doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that this <hi>aſſociation</hi> began foure or fiue yeres ſince, <hi>Cap. 7. Apol. fol. 90.</hi> and that muſt needs be before thoſe prieſts came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, on whom it is fathered, if it be true, which is ſayd <hi>Cap. 2. Apol. fol. 12,</hi> that they were not gone from Rome at the beginning of <hi>September 1597.</hi> It may alſo be gathered out of the ſame Chapter <hi>fol. 89.</hi> that this <hi>aſſociation</hi> very probably was begun long before by others: for there we finde this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>But</hi> (<hi>M.</hi> Muſh) <hi>returning into England, as he went forth, and the Cardinall ſoone after dying</hi> (in the yeere 1594. as appeareth <hi>Cap. 1. Apol fol 6.</hi>) <hi>hee ioyned with another of his owne humour &amp;c. And they two, with ſome few other, determined to make a certaine new</hi> Hierarchy <hi>of their owne, calling it</hi> an aſſociation <hi>of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men &amp;c.</hi> The truth is, that M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> and M. <hi>Dudley</hi> hauing made the peace at <hi>Wisbich</hi> in the yeere 1595. (as appeareth <hi>Ca. 6. Apol fol. 79.</hi>) returned to London, and there dealt with M. <hi>Iames Standiſh,</hi> a man growing in deed into that humor (to wit of being a Ieſuit, which M. <hi>Muſh</hi> was then leauing) and not with M. <hi>Colington</hi> (as is here falſly noted in the margent, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time M. <hi>Collington</hi> lay very little at, or neere London) and they, and ſome others thought it very fit, that there ſhould be an <hi>aſſociation</hi> of ſuch prieſts as would liue vnder rule, to take away that ſlander, which the Ieſuits, &amp; their fauourites (to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ambitious attempts) had generally ſpread abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prieſts, to wit, that they liued not vnder rule. And thus much concerning this firſt falſhood, and the deluding his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5209:23"/> Holineſſe with this tale, that the <hi>aſſociation</hi> was a new deuiſe of ſuch as were in thoſe broiles at Rome, and would not remaine in that peace which was commended vnto them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Holines in the yere 1597.</p>
               <p>The ſecond falſhood is more deceitfully (although as groſly) conueyed, in putting his Holines in mind, what was his ſecond motiue, in the ordaining our <hi>eaſie and ſweete Subordination:</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, <hi>the letters and requeſts of diuers of the graueſt prieſts of our nation, which after we ſhal cite.</hi> And becauſe he wil ſeem to deale faithfully in this cauſe, he putteth this note in the margent, Ca. 9 10. <hi>Apol.</hi> by which his Hol. is giuen to vnderſtand, that thoſe letters and requeſts of the graueſt prieſts, by which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to make this ſubordination, are to be found in the ninth and tenth Chapt. of the <hi>Apol.</hi> But now what if there be not any letters, or requeſts in the ninth or tenth Chapt. concerning any ſuch matter, what a ſhameleſſe felow is this informer? In the ninth chapter <hi>fol. 125.</hi> begin certain letters of ſome prieſts, and others follow: but theſe are not, neither can be the motiues of his Holineſſe to make this <hi>Subordination:</hi> they are written parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againſt <hi>M. D. Biſhop,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnock:</hi> becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to goe to his Holines about this <hi>Subordination,</hi> already made as it was: And this is euident to thoſe, who will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to turne vnto the chapters. In the tenth chapter there is leſſe matter, if leſſe may be, for this purpoſe; that I cannot but marueile how this fellow durſt tell his Holines ſuch a lewd tale: But perchance this good fellow had this policie: he ſet in the margent <hi>the 9 and 10. chapters,</hi> hoping that his Holines, if he ſhould chance to cauſe them to be turned into <hi>Latin,</hi> would be ſo tired with ſeeking in the ninth, as he would rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, they were in the 10. chapt. then be ſo troubled againe: perchance this marginall note was ſet but in the Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, where it would ſerue well enough for thoſe, which haue ſuch a facilitie in beleeuing ſuch like felowes as this is, as they will runne ryot with them, howſoeuer their conſcience diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it. Perchance it was miſtaken, and this <hi>9. and 10. chapters</hi> were put in the margent in ſtead of the <hi>eighth.</hi> And this we are induced to beleeue the rather, becauſe at the beginning of the eighth chap. this very matter is handled, and ſome letters
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5209:24"/> cited: and for the better ſatisfaction of the reader, I will here ſet downe the place at large, to which (as I ſuppoſe) this felow alludeth, and had rather his Reader ſhould miſſe the place then hit it, becauſe retaining a confuſed remembrance of ſuch matters he ſhould runne away with it, without further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the trueth, or the likelyhood thereof. Theſe are the words in the <hi>Apology,</hi> cap. 8. fol. 98. <hi>When his Holineſſe heard the former ſtate of the matters in England, Flanders, and other places, and of the murmurations of ſome againſt the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> ſocietie, <hi>ſet down aſwell in the foreſaid contumelious</hi> Memoriall, <hi>as by diuers other letters and relations which came to the</hi> Protectors <hi>ſight, and by him was related to his Holines, and namely when he receiued great ſtore of priuate and publike letters out of England againſt the ſayd</hi> Memoriall of Fiſher, <hi>and ſome one with aboue an 100. hands at it, other with 40, and 50, all in fauour and commendation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their labours, and behauiour in England, againſt the ſayd ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous</hi> Memoriall, <hi>and many other in ſeuerall letters of principall men, which are yet extant: when alſo diuers of theſe did expreſly demaund ſome</hi> Subordination <hi>and gouernement of Secular prieſts, to take away this emulation of ſome few againſt the</hi> Fathers, <hi>and that two lately came out of England at that very time: one a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, the other a ſecular prieſt, each of them vrging the ſame in the behalfe both of the one, and the other order; his Holineſſe after mature deliberation reſolued to yeelde thereunto, hoping thereby to quiet all, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo he goeth forward, and ſheweth how it was conſulted vpon, and of whom opinions were asked, to wit, of F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> F. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who was one of the two, which lately came out of England, as appeareth by the marginall note in that place, <hi>M. Doctor Haddock, M. Martin Array, M. Iames Standiſh,</hi> who was the other which came out of England, as appeareth by the ſame marginall note, although falſly ſayd to bee a ſecular prieſt, hauing giuen his name long before to become a Ieſuite, and gaue it out here in England, that his going ouer was to enter into their order, &amp; others that had laboured in the Engliſh vineyard, perchance <hi>Fa. Warford,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ieſuit, &amp; ſuch like: but thoſe matters we ſhall handle there in that place. Here onely we haue noted this relation out of the 8. chap. to help the fauourers of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> that they wander
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5209:24"/> not through the woods to no purpoſe, if they follow not the path which their author ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo bring them where they may find ſomewhat, (although not that which they looke for) after a long ſeeking, where there is nothing at all of this matter. And if this be not the place, which is meant in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, there is none in all the <hi>Apologie.</hi> For this quotation in the margent <hi>fol. 101.</hi> in the ſame chapt. <hi>See the letter of 6. anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent prieſts, the 13. of</hi> September <hi>1597.</hi> is a poore proofe, and to ſay the trueth it would bee more for the others credit, if there were none at all cited in the <hi>Apologie.</hi> For if any man will be ſo indifferent in this caſe, as but to looke vnto the dates of the letters here cited in the beginning of the eighth chapter in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> (which by the Contents ſeemeth to bee the place, which muſt iuſtifie as much, as is ſuggeſted in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) and conferre them with the date of Cardinal <hi>Caietane</hi> his letter, by which this Subordination was appointed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, he ſhall finde that they were all written after the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters, ſome longer, ſome leſſe while, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Holines his determination, to make this <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and therefore could not be any motiue thereof. The letter of the Card. <hi>Caietane</hi> by which the <hi>Subordination</hi> was appointed in England, beareth date the 7. of <hi>March 1598,</hi> as appeareth in that 8 chapter, <hi>fol. 102.</hi> And the letters by which his Holines is ſayd to haue been mooued to make this <hi>Subordination</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and are cited in this 8. chapter, <hi>fol. 98,</hi> beare date, ſome the 27 of <hi>March,</hi> ſome the 20 of <hi>Aprill,</hi> ſome the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> ſome the 30 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the ſooneſt the foure and twentieth of <hi>March 1598:</hi> all which muſt needes argue not onely an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſhood in this Epiſtle-maker, but a notorious impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in telling his Holineſſe to his teeth, that hee did make an <hi>eaſie and ſweete Subordination</hi> vpon the letters, and requeſts, which he had neuer heard of, nor poſſibly could, they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been written or thought vpon by the Inditors, long after his Holineſſe is ſayd to haue thought vpon the <hi>Subordination,</hi> and cauſed it to be made by the Card <hi>Caietane.</hi> And as for the note in the margent, <hi>fol. 101.</hi> it is not probable that a letter of that moment would not haue been ſet in the booke much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then any other.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:5209:25"/>
               <p>With the like libertie this Epiſtle is continued: His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is told, that <hi>all good and obedient Catholicks were much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and comforted with this</hi> ſubordination: which is a moſt iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſinuation againſt many, who (to make no odious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons) haue ſhewed themſelues in all points, as hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the beſt, &amp; moſt obedient Catholicks. Neither are there any <hi>letters</hi> at all in the 9. Chap. of the <hi>Apol.</hi> of this <hi>thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,</hi> as the Pope is here told, and thoſe which are in the 8. cha. are not from any of the Laitie, but from ſome prieſts, all whoſe names are for ſome cauſes omitted in this <hi>Apol.</hi> except the firſt ſubſcriber, &amp; the laſt, which perchance was therefore thought neceſſary to be ſet downe, to proue that at the leaſt there were two to a letter: and that the middle names might bee as many in number, as are here ſuppoſed. But it was a marueilous good chance, that the firſt ſubſcriber, and the laſt were ſuch, as their names might be knowen. But perchance, vnder the name of all good, and obedient Catholicks, the Engliſh Clergie is alſo to be vnderſtood, of which <hi>a few</hi> (ſaith this <hi>Epiſtle-maker</hi>) <hi>not the twentieth part, and thoſe for the moſt part ſuch, as had bene trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome before in Rome, preſumed to impugne the ſame</hi> ſubordination, <hi>calling first in queſtion the ſaid Cardinals letters, &amp;c. Fa. Parſons</hi> was told in Rome, that doubleſſe the greater part of the prieſts was not contented with this <hi>ſubordination,</hi> &amp; when for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he vrged further, <hi>how many the meſsengers did certainely know, to approue their miſsion</hi> (as appeareth Cap. 9. fol. 131.) they (not being willing to depoſe for more in this kinde, then they had either ſpoken withall, or receiued letters from them to this effect) anſwered accordingly that they <hi>had certaine knowledge of ſome 14. or 15,</hi> which number is now deceitfully toſſed vp, and downe, as though they had no knowledge of any more, or did come in the name of ſo few againſt all the reſt; yet where there was iuſt cauſe if they had bene fewer, yea if there had bene no more but thoſe two, who went to Rome, they had ben enough, becauſe iuſtice hath alwayes more with it, then againſt it. But to this purpoſe, if thoſe 14, or 15, which were named by M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> in his examination, were here ſet downe, the falſhood of this felow would be euident to thoſe who know the men, when he ſuggeſteth to his Hol. that they were for the moſt part ſuch,

Concerning the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this <hi>ſubordination</hi> in queſtion, how it was procured, how far forth it did binde, before the <hi>Breue</hi> came, and other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the prieſts had, they haue not deſired to haue them muttered in corners, as may appeare by their bookes: to which their aduerſaries ſilence would haue beene ſomewhat more for their credit, then their ſhuffling anſwere. And as for the euill ſucceſſe, which their two meſſengers had, whome at the firſt they ſent to Rome, all the world knoweth, that not long after his Holines comming thither, they were infamouſly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Ieſuits and <hi>Sbirri,</hi> all their writings were taken from them, they were kept aſunder in cloſe priſon, and were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſpeake with any to aske counſell, nor to ſee the Copie of ſuch accuſations as were put vp againſt them, at ſuch time as they did demand it, to make their anſwere before the two Cardinals, <hi>Caietane</hi> and <hi>Burgheſius 17. Feb. 1599.</hi> and yet they were kept afterwards cloſe priſoners vntill the 8. of <hi>April,</hi> by which time all matters were concluded as their aduerſaries would, as appeareth by the date of the <hi>Breue</hi> which was the 6. of <hi>April 1599.</hi>

               <p>The notorious falſhood alſo which here is ſuggeſted to his Holineſſe in theſe words, <hi>Who</hi> (that is the two Prieſts) <hi>finding not ſuch ſucceſſe</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">At Rome.</note> 
                  <hi>there, as they required, their fellowes in England for remedie, began to deale more cloſely with the Counſell, telling them (as hath appeared ſince by the euent, and by their latter bookes) that this ſubordination was not for Religion, but for State practiſes, as in this Apologie is declared more particularly:</hi> And in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is ſet this note, <hi>Apol. cap. 10.12.13.</hi> But whoſoeuer wil exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the tenth Chapter, he ſhall find a few idle, and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed aſſertions, or rather fooliſh coniectures, which are in as great neede to be proued, as this is here. In the twelfth Chapter there is not one word, wiſe, or other to this purpoſe. In the thirteenth Chapter, there is ſome proofe brought for that, which is here propoſed to his Holineſſe. But the proofe is ſuch, as it would haue made a man of little modeſtie to haue bluſhed with the very conceite thereof. Marke I pray you, what a narration there is, fol. 209. For this is it, which is ment, as may appeare by this marginall note, <hi>D. Bagſhaw. But aboue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5209:26"/> all other meanes the fowleſt is, and ought moſt to mooue a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their ioyning ſecretly for a time, but after, more openly: and now, moſt euidently with the common enemie, and perſecuter. First (as before you haue heard) as ſoone as euer they vnderſtood, that their two meſſengers were reſtrained in Rome, and not like to preuaile, then</hi> D. Bagſhaw <hi>was ſent for from</hi> Wisbich <hi>to London, to treat with the Councell, &amp;c.</hi> The Pope is tolde in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that the Prieſts deale <hi>cloſely</hi> with the Councell: but in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> the Catholikes are told, that it hath bene <hi>ſecretly</hi> for a time, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>more openly,</hi> and now, <hi>moſt euidently.</hi> The Prieſts haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bene readie to giue an account, in what, and how farre, they haue vſed that fauour, which her Maieſtie, and the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Councell are ſaid to haue ſhewen vnto them: and all men are to thinke, that they would not haue gone to Rome, if they had done any thing, which Catholike prieſtes might not doe. But marke, I pray you, the ſubſtantiall proofe to which his Holineſſe is referred: and let it be duely examined: <hi>As ſoone as euer they vnderſtood, that their two meſſengers were reſtrained in Rome, and not like to preuaile, then D.</hi> Bagſhaw <hi>was ſent for from</hi> Wisbich <hi>to London, to treate with the Councell, &amp;c.</hi> If we looke into the <hi>Apologie,</hi> we ſhall finde, that the two meſſengers came to Rome vpon the xj. of <hi>December 1598. cap. 9. fol. 121.</hi> and they were impriſoned vpon the 29. of the ſame moneth. And M. D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> his ſending for was not ſo ſecretly done, but that all England may quickly vnderſtand, that he was long before this time at London, and that hee was either returned againe to <hi>Wisbich,</hi> or vpon his returning, before it was knowen in England, that the two Prieſts were reſtrained in Rome. And yet his Holineſſe muſt needes be tolde, that <hi>vpon their reſtraint in December,</hi> and by reaſon thereof, <hi>D. Bagſhaw was ſent for from</hi> Wisbich, <hi>to treate with the Councell,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>October.</hi> Can any thing make this fellowe bluſh, who is ſo generally careleſſe, what he publiſheth to the world? or can the Cath. expect, that hee ſhould deale more faithfully with them for their inſtruction, who will ſo boldly abuſe his Holineſſe?</p>
               <p>All that alſo which followeth in the 13. point, touched in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to his Holineſſe, conſiſteth vpon diuers vntrueths ſhuffled in one vpon another: as firſt, that <hi>the two Cardinals,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:5209:26"/> Caietane <hi>and</hi> Burgheſius, <hi>did duely examine all matters.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>the Priests did but make a ſhew to obey the</hi> Breue <hi>(as hauing engaged themſelues before with the Councell to the contrary) and thereupon ſought occaſions to breake againe.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>they ſent not any to proſecute their appeale.</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>they did not expect his Holines ſentence or definition, but proceeded by ſecret fauour, and intelligence with the Councel, and Biſh. of</hi> London, <hi>to print and ſet forth erronious libels to the detraction of diuers venerable men, and of a whole order of Religion, and of their immediate ſuperiours, and of the ſea of Rome it ſelfe, of his Holineſse, and the</hi> Protectors <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this matter.</hi> To the firſt it is anſwered, that all matters were not duly examined, when the two Prieſts were not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deale, neither as plaintifes, nor as defendants, beeing clapped vp cloſe priſoners, all their inſtructions taken away from them, not ſuffered to ſpeake one with another, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with any man elſe about thoſe matters, for which they came: examined by F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who made ſuch Interrogatories as were for his purpoſe, being the principall aduerſarie on the other part, and curtailed their anſweres when it pleaſed him, or blotted out both Interrogatories and anſweres when they ſucceeded not to his mind: being brought before the two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, <hi>Caietane</hi> and <hi>Burgheſius,</hi> where after they had heard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally ſome part of their examinations read, they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come together to heare a libel read ioyntly againſt them both, but were not ſuffered to haue the copie thereof, to make their anſwere thereunto, as they deſired: and beeing friendly diſmiſſed for that inſtant, were afterwards kept cloſe priſoners ſeuen weekes longer, and not ſuffered to come together, vntill the <hi>Breue</hi> was out in confirmation of the authority. And thus much for the <hi>due examination of all matters,</hi> which is here ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to his Holines. To the ſecond it is anſwered, That the Prieſts made an vnfeined peace for their parts, and ſought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes to haue all ſuch queſtions ended, as might be cauſe of contention betweene them, as may appeare both by their offer of diſputation, and their ſending to <hi>Paris</hi> for their further reſolution, and ſatisfaction of their ghoſtly children, after their offer of diſputation was reiected by the <hi>Archprieſt.</hi> It is alſo well knowen, that the Counſell was not ſo enformed at that

And where it is ſaid here, that <hi>the Prieſts ſought occaſions to breake againe,</hi> it is moſt vntrue: the contention was renued by the Ieſuits, who after the peace was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, gaue their cenſure, that thoſe Prieſts were <hi>ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes,</hi> who had deferred to ſubiect themſelues to the new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority before they ſaw the <hi>Breue.</hi> And this contention was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed through the default of the Archpr. who being certified of the Ieſuits raſhnes in their ſpeeches concerning this point, did ſhew himſelfe to be of the ſame opinion: and furthermore gaue direction, that the prieſts ſhould make account of their being <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> and ſatisfie, before they ſhould receiue the benefit of abſolution, as appeareth by the <hi>reſolution</hi> diuulged by him from the <hi>mother citie.</hi> Of all which, the <hi>Breue</hi> dated the <hi>17. Auguſt. 1601.</hi> taketh notice. And in the relation thereof, his Holines vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>Quod dolentes referimus,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>which with griefe we relate.</hi> And therefore it muſt be great want of ſhame, to tell his Holines in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that <hi>the Prieſts either made a ſhew to obey, or ſought occaſions to breake againe.</hi> And this teſtimony out of the <hi>Breefe</hi> is of the more force, if it be true which is ſaid in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Appendix,</hi> that his Holineſſe had not vnderſtood of any of theſe <hi>ſcandalous bookes</hi> (for ſo it pleaſeth this author to terme the bookes which the Prieſts ſet out) when he wrote the <hi>Breue,</hi> and therefore could not receiue any ſuch information by them, as he doth follow in the <hi>Breue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third matter is now anſwered by the Prieſts, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Rome.</p>
               <p>To the fourth it is anſwered, that notwithſtanding the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, the Archprieſt proceeded againſt the Appellants, and principally becauſe they had appealed; as may appeare by many acts which he did: and for this in particular, there is yet his owne hand to ſhew, to a lay gentleman of the <hi>16.</hi> of <hi>April 1601. This I write vnto you, to make you priuie of the great ſpirituall danger, wherein you, and all that receiue any ſacrament of</hi> M. Oſw. Needam, <hi>may be, if it be ſo, that hee hath ſubſcribed to a ſeditious pamphlet coloured with the name of an</hi> Appeale. And in reſpect that the Archprieſt did in this maner proceed againſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5209:31"/> without <hi>expecting his Hol. ſentence and definition,</hi> which they might haue procured, notwithſtanding his moſt irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent refutaries, the Appellants proceeded to publiſh their cauſe in print without <hi>detraction,</hi> or defamation, more then is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the following of the cauſe in queſtion. And whereas it is here ſaid, that <hi>a whole religion is defamed,</hi> it is moſt vntrue: as appeareth by the booke to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> pag. 5. <hi>the Sea of Rome</hi> is no way diſhonoured, but rather maintained, and all lawfull ſuperioritie: neither were theſe bookes printed <hi>by ſecret fauour and intelligence with the Councel and Biſhop of London:</hi> For which this only argument might ſatisfie an indifferent man, that they would haue had a more skilfull man to haue printed them, and not to haue one to worke, who (as the <hi>Latine</hi> booke doth very well ſhew) did not vnderſtand one word in <hi>Latine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His exceptions againſt certaine propoſitions, as <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and <hi>temerarious,</hi> leaue ſome doubt in a man of iudgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this felow be more ignorant or more malicious. He refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Holines to the 2. and 11. Chap. of the <hi>Apol.</hi> where hee doeth too-much diſcredit himſelfe, as ſhalbe there ſhewed. But leſt the Reader ſhould conceiue, according to the broadneſſe of theſe termes, we will here only note the propoſitions, which he termeth <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and <hi>temerarious,</hi> and ſo leaue them, vntill their place come to be defended. <hi>Authoritie is not an infallible rule of trueth in all, who haue authoritie. No man is bound in all things to beleeue or execute, what euery man in authoritie ouer him ſhall put vpon him. Archprieſts, and their ſuperiors alſo the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and other of higher degree haue done amiſse, and ſwarued from the trueth; and who vpon earth is warranted from erring, but one, and not he in all things.</hi> Theſe propoſitions are put in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of the <hi>Apol. fol. 16.</hi> and in the margent, there is this note: <hi>Dangerous, and offenſiue doctrine.</hi> And in the ſame Chap. <hi>fol. 19.</hi> there is exception taken at this propoſition, <hi>The ſacrament of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation is either most neceſsary in time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or altogether vaine, and as a ſuperfluous ceremony in Gods Church.</hi> And in the margent there is this note ſet, <hi>A very teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious propoſition:</hi> and he proueth it, becauſe it is not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to ſaluation. If this fellow had euer bene a Souldier, he would haue conceiued the neceſſitie perchance, of Armor,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5209:32"/> and weapons in warres, although no man will ſay, that armor, or weapons are <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to the getting of a kingdom. In the 11. Chapter here quoted, there is nothing but a certaine remembrance of this point, with a reference to the 2. Chapter, where what is ſaid, ſhalbe diſcuſſed, and anſwered with leſſe danger of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> then this good fellow is in. And whereas here alſo it is ſaid, that <hi>by the Priests their owne letters it may be proued, that they haue dealt expreſſely with the Queene and Counſell against the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>and ſuch as ſtand with them:</hi> It is a falſe bragge, and wil be taken for ſuch, vnleſſe ſome other letter be forged, then that which is cited in the 13. Chap. For this doeth not proue any ſuch matter, as any man may ſee. Theſe are the words in that letter <hi>fol. 210, I haue in ſome ſort pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the wrath of our Prince, conceiued against vs, and of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and haue layed the fault, where it ought to be, and proued that the Secular priests are innocent for the moſt part.</hi> Which words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not import, that he, who writ this letter, had <hi>dealt againſt</hi> any, but onely that he had dealt for ſome, who were before thought to be as deepe in matters diſpleaſing to the State, as others: the State being before out of doubt, that there were ſuch plots, as were not beſeeming ſubiects, &amp; much leſſe beſeeming men of our calling, and ſo much the more odious, by how much the ſhew of piety is dangerous, for the effecting of any ſtratageme; And the Counſell thought, that all had bene of one ſtampe: wherein the Inditer of that letter affirmeth, he hath otherwiſe enformed them, and freed the innocent. Now we wil ſee, how this Author beginneth to cloſe vp his Holines mouth with as notorious a falſhood, as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They haue obteyned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that foure of their ſeditious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that were in priſon before, haue libertie vnder the Queenes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patents, to ride vp and downe all England for a time, to gather money, and letters, which few Cath. will dare to deny them, least they detect them to the Councell, &amp;c.</hi> This alſo is a meditation vpon the ſame letter, which is before cited, and is to be found in the 13. Chap. of the <hi>Apol. fol. 210.</hi> wherein are theſe words: <hi>I haue (by opening the caſe vnto their Honours and to Caeſar) obteyned that foure principall men ſhalbe baniſhed after a ſort, to follow the appeale,</hi> D. Bagſhaw, Bluet, Champney, <hi>&amp;</hi> Barneley, <hi>all priſoners: they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5209:32"/> ſhall be here with me on Wedneſday next. A moneth they ſhall haue within the Realme, to ride abroad for money amongst their friends, and then chuſe their port, &amp;c.</hi> And from hence perchance this fellow had ſome part of his intelligence: but how commeth he to inlarge himſelfe ſo farre, as to ſay, that theſe Prieſts had <hi>her Maieſties letters Patents?</hi> vpon what record hath he found this? or doth he meane thereby to draw the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as though he ſtood now in his light for ſome what, which he hath to effect, (all <hi>Letters patents</hi> being at his perill vpon record?) or doth he know any Cath. who in ſuch quandaries did giue theſe Prieſts any money? we knowe ſome, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great <hi>bond</hi> they had to ſome of them, would not ſee them, neither would the prieſts preſſe vppon them. Some againe we know, who were requeſted to giue ſomewhat to their iourney to Rome, if not for loue of the men, yet for the loue which they pretended to peace, and to haue a final end of the controuerſie, which could not be had but at Rome: and nothing would be giuen. But this fellow careth not, what he ſaieth to the Pope, preſuming perchance, that by ſome way or other, all acceſſe ſhould be ſhut, and his falſhood ſhould neuer bee diſcouered. And thus forgetting that which hee ſaith in the <hi>Apologie cap. 11. fol. 162.</hi> that <hi>the intention of the Prieſts ſeemeth not to be, to informe his Holineſſe, but to make a noiſe in England, and to gaine time of libertie, and to preoccupate ſome mens minds, by making a ſhew, that they appeale to the higheſt in this their controuerſie, but yet indeed would be loth that hee ſhould know it, and much lother to anſwere it before him, eſpecially this Pope,</hi> &amp;c, Here he telleth the Pope in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that <hi>the Prieſts are to paſſe into France, and there, by the helpe of the Queenes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and other meanes, to procure (if they can) his</hi> moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Maieſties letters to your Holines in their fauor, pretending that they can get the Queene of England to giue libertie of conſcience, to ſome Catholicke, vnder certaine conditions, whereof ſome muſt bee, that</hi> the Ieſuits muſt goe forth of England. <hi>All this is in handling (moſt holy Father) by the children of iniquitie, againſt Gods cauſe, and his ſeruants, and will no doubt, bring forth lamentable effects, if your Holines doe not ſpeedily put your hand thereunto. In this</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie <hi>we do lay downe, by cleare hiſtoricall narration, and authenticall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5209:33"/> teſtimonies, the grounds of all. Chriſt our Sauiour inſpire your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c.</hi> In the 10. Chap. of the <hi>Apol. fol. 147.</hi> there is a prayer made to God, by the Archpr. <hi>to giue him his grace, ſo to vſe Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>benefits, as that neuer he abuſe them, and that neuer hee fall into any ingratefull behauiour, &amp;c.</hi> And in the margent there is this note, <hi>A prophecie of the Archprieſt to Fa. Parſons.</hi> How much more worthily doeth this place in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> deſerue to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>a prophecie?</hi> but perchance hee was loath, that there ſhould be any ſuch <hi>prophecie,</hi> as that any good, or eaſe ſhould come to the Catholicks, by the abſence of the Ieſuits in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Wotteth he not, that his Holines knoweth, that no euill is to be done, although good ſhould enſue thereon? If it be a ſinfull act, to call the Ieſuits out of England, what feare is there, that his Holines would doe it? If it be no ſinfull acte, to call them out of England: and that thereupon may come eaſe, and quiet to the Church, which hath bene a long time in the more grieuous perſecution, in regard of the hard opinion, which our Prince, and Counſell haue had of their ſtatizing, vnder a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of pietie, and Religion: how farre are theſe fellowes from that Spirit of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who willingly yeelded himſelfe rather to be throwen out of the ſhip into the ſea, then that through his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault thoſe, who were in it, ſhould periſh? But of theſe matters we ſhall haue cauſe elſwhere, to delate more at large. And in the meane while wee make humble requeſt to the indifferent Readers, to note well throughout the <hi>Apologie</hi> how farre this Author is from all Authenticall teſtimonies, in laying downe the grounds of all ſuch matters, as are now in queſtion: for we are not here to ſtand vpon ſuch impertinent ſtuffe, as he thruſteth into his booke, to the end, that by ſhuffling in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſome part of our matters, he might make them odious to ſuch, as will runne ouer his packes without ſearching into them, what is therein belonging to our controuerſie, and how little coherence it hath with that other, with which it is ioyned.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Preface</hi> of this <hi>Apologie</hi> is to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of England <hi>to fore-arme, &amp; forewarne them, what is meant thereby, leſt the matter being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken, then it ought to be, ſhould yeeld to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and thereby ouerthrow</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and worke your ruine which is intended, and permitted by Almighty God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all mercies to your triall, and greater merit, &amp;c.</hi> But this <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming</hi> of the Catholiks is ſuch, as they ought all to be <hi>forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> what is meant by this his <hi>fore-arming.</hi> For what Catholike, or <hi>worthy ſeruant of God</hi> (as he tearmeth them) hath euer before this time beleeued, that either <hi>ſcandall,</hi> or their <hi>ruine hath been intended,</hi> howſoeuer it hath been <hi>permitted by Almighty God</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome cauſe beſt knowen vnto his diuine Maieſtie? For how farre off is this <hi>fore-arming,</hi> or <hi>forewarning</hi> from his doctrine, who ſayth, that the betraying of Chriſt was Gods acte in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, aſwell as repentance in S. Peter? But I pray you ſee how he goeth on, affirming that <hi>Chriſt ſent aduerſaries to afflict his Church:</hi> and which is moſt ridiculous, he auoucheth that <hi>he ſent a new kind of aduerſaries neuer heard of in the world before, named heretikes, that tooke vnto themſelues the name of the beſt ſort of Chriſtians &amp;c.</hi> If there were no <hi>heretikes</hi> before, what were the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and <hi>Sadduces?</hi> Of whom <hi>Ioſeph lib. 18. Antiqui. Iud. cap. 2.</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>the</hi> Phariſes <hi>held opinion that thoſe ſoules, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeparation from the body were found good, did returne againe to ſome other bodies.</hi> And that <hi>the</hi> Sadduces <hi>did thinke that the ſoule died with the body.</hi> And doubtleſſe this was the cauſe, why it is ſo preciſely recorded in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees cap. 12.</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> did thinke piouſly, and religiouſly of the reſurrection? For about this time did theſe people riſe, and fell very quickly into theſe <hi>hereſies,</hi> perchance the ſooner for their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5209:34"/> very great pride, which they tooke of their ouer ſelfe-weening religious courſe of life. Of the <hi>Saduces</hi> we haue many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the new Teſtament, and of their error, as Math. 22. Mar. 12. Luk 20. and Act 23. but two notable places there are in the Acts of the Apoſtles, which ſhew not onely, that theſe were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but <hi>hereſies,</hi> and that they were <hi>Heretikes,</hi> who are related by the Euangeliſt, to haue aſſaulted our Sauiour. We reade in the 5. chapter a company thus deſcribed: <hi>Quae eſt hereſis Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducaeorum,</hi> which is the hereſie of the <hi>Saduces.</hi> And in the 24. chapter: <hi>Tertullus</hi> the oratour accuſeth S. <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Foelix</hi> the Preſident in this manner, <hi>Inuenimus, &amp;c. We found this peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fellow both raiſing contention againſt all the Iewes in the world, and broaching the ſedition of the ſect of thoſe of Nazareth.</hi> And for that word <hi>ſect</hi> there is in the Greeke copie <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>hereſie.</hi> And in the ſame chap. S. Paul anſwering for himſelfe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>he ſerued God in that way, which his accuſers called</hi> hereſie. Can there be any plainer Teſtimonies, that there were <hi>hereſies</hi> among the Iewes, and ſo accounted by them, and the men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed thereof, who held ſuch opinions? But this good fellow writeth to ſuch, as hee thinketh will not bee euill conceited of him, howſoeuer he abuſeth them, or himſelfe, but will rather take his wordes for oracles, how contrary ſoeuer they are to trueth. Hereupon alſo he emboldeneth himſelfe to caſt many doubts, and ſuſpitions into his readers head, againſt the prieſts whom he calleth <hi>Libellers.</hi> Firſt becauſe (as he ſayth) <hi>There is no certaine author of their bookes named.</hi> Secondly, becauſe <hi>no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of ſuperiors for printing is named.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe <hi>worthy men are defamed by name without intention, or poſsibility to proue it by lawful meanes.</hi> To the firſt I anſwere, that the authors names are as leageably ſet downe in the bookes, which the prieſts ſet out, as the authors names of this Apologie. That booke which is dedicated to his Holineſſe is ſet out by the prieſts vnder their owne names, as appeareth by the title of the booke, where it is ſayd to be giuen to his Hol. <hi>by the prieſts who were moſt vniuſtly defamed of ſchiſme and other crimes.</hi> And in the <hi>appeale</hi> their names are particularly ſet downe who they are, Pag. 119. and the other are ſet out in the ſame maner. And this <hi>Apologie</hi> is ſayd to be written, and ſet forth <hi>by prieſts vnited in due ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5209:34"/> to the Archpr.</hi> but the reader muſt go looke, who they are. This exception therefore againſt the prieſts bookes is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and proueth that the <hi>Apologie</hi> commeth neerer to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Libel,</hi> then the Prieſts books. To the ſecond I anſwer, that in caſe the <hi>Superiour</hi> be a party &amp; laboureth what he may with all men, that the trueth of the queſtion be not knowen, and to that end forbiddeth, that any thing be written, or read, which may giue ſatisfaction to indifferent men, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to expect his licence, neither is it a note of a <hi>Libel</hi> to print without it.</p>
               <p>To the third I anſwere, that there is no man touched in theſe bookes, but for ſuch matters, and vpon ſuch ground, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them are ready to iuſtifie, and haue alreadie ſhewed, that they haue intention to proue them. In which this <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> fayling, as it muſt needes doe, the author hath alreadie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen iudgement againſt himſelfe, that he is a notorious <hi>libeller,</hi> and that he hath brought all his followers, and furtherers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (whether conſenters, or ſpreaders of it abroad) into a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie caſe, God amend them. But let vs, I pray you, examine the cauſe, why this <hi>Apologie</hi> was written: (the authour thereof blaming ſo often the Prieſts for writing) <hi>Diuers points</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you know already, and ſome more you are like to perceiue by this our</hi> Apologie <hi>(being driuen thereunto) but not all, for auoiding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcandall: which reſpect of ſcandall ſhould haue withheld vs wholly from putting pen to paper in this cauſe, if the intemperance of ſome perſons (giuen ouer as it ſeemeth to choler and reuenge, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting both themſelues and others, and the times wherein they liue) had not broken foorth of late to ſuch exceſſe, as we are forced againſt our wils, to put ſome ſtop, or bridle to ſo licentious and ſcandalous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, leſt it infect euen the good, and trouble the ſtrongest, when they ſee ſuch enormous matters paſſe without controlement.</hi> In this iuſtification of his ſetting foorth this <hi>Apologie</hi> we gather, firſt that ſcandall is not alwayes to be auoyded: For as he ſaieth: <hi>The reſpect of ſcandal ſhould haue withheld him wholly from putting pen to paper in this caſe, if the intemperance, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance belike of ſome perſons may excuſe a man doing that, whereupon ſcandall may ariſe. Note I pray you, how this fellow can change his hew, when it ſhall make for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5209:35"/> When hee will write himſelfe, then <hi>the intemperance of ſome perſons</hi> is a ſufficient excuſe for him, although ſcandall ariſe thereon. And when he would haue others blamed, who were more grieuouſly iniured, and prouoked thereby to write then he is: he can preach vnto them, that S. Paul was of a ſpirit and iudgement contrary to theirs, <note place="margin">1. Corinth. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>who doth ſo greatly exaggerate the danger of ſcandalizing any one of our brethren for whom Chriſt died (as he ſayd) that he would rather neuer eate meate, then doe it.</hi> Thus ſaith this <hi>Apologie-maker</hi> in his <hi>Appendix, fol. 16.</hi> And there he goeth on alſo, and ſheweth what Chriſt himſelfe ſaid: <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>That it were better ſuffer death in moſt hideous manner (to wit, with a milſtone at our neckes to be caſt into the ſea) then to ſcandalize the leaſt of them, that beleeue in him, that be our Chriſtian and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike brethren.</hi> And then he concludeth in this maner: <hi>So as this other diuinitie, that it may be done for ſauing of our credites, mainteining our good names, and other commodities, was not then knowen, and commeth now downe from a contrary ſpirit, and Maſter, to Chriſt and S. Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this then it followeth, that howſoeuer the Prieſts can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid blame, this <hi>Apologie-maker</hi> is in the lurch, who (hauing ſo great skill, not onely in the ſayings of S. Paul, but of Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and in diuinity, and the true meaning of it) notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he thought that ſome ſcandall would growe by this his acte, aduentured contrary to true diuinitie to write this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</hi> The diuinitie which the prieſts doe profeſſe, teacheth them that the ſcandall of little ones is to be auoided: and the ſcandall of <hi>Phariſes</hi> is to be contemned. And as they reade in one place: <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui ſcandalizauerit &amp;c. Whoſoeuer ſhall ſcandalize one of theſe little ones, which beleeue in mee, it were better for him that he had a milſtone hung about his necke, and he drowned in the bottome of the ſea.</hi> So in another place they finde, that Chriſt (when his diſciples told him that the <hi>Phariſes</hi> were ſcandalized at that which he ſaid) anſwered, <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinite illos, &amp;c. Let them alone, they are blind, and guiders of the blind.</hi> There are diuers reaſons ſet foorth by the Prieſts, to iuſtifie their publiſhing of their bookes: but to an indifferent Reader this place of the <hi>Preface</hi> is warrant inough, ſince that in this authors opinion, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no other caufe, then <hi>to put ſome ſtop or bridle to ſo licentious
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5209:35"/> and ſcandalous proceedings, leaſt it infect, euen the good, and trouble the ſtrongeſt, when they ſee ſuch enormous matters paſſe, without controulment.</hi> Was there euer any <hi>ſo licentious and ſcandalous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> as haue beene againſt the Prieſtes? Can Fa. <hi>Liſters,</hi> the Ieſuites treatize of <hi>Schiſme</hi> be matched for exceſſe, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt Catholike prieſts? was there euer ſuch an outrage committed in Chriſtendome by any Catholike to another, as this is, <hi>Harken, O ye factious, ye are Rebels, yee are Schiſmatikes, and fallen out of the Church, and ſpouſe of Chriſt, yee haue troden vnder your feete the obedience which yee owe to the higheſt Biſhop: yee haue ſinned againſt all humane faith and authoritie, by reiecting a moral certainty in a morall matter: yee haue violently run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, &amp; irregularitie: ye haue loſt your faculties, by which you ſhould haue gained ſoules to Chriſt: ye haue ſo ſcandalized all the godly, as now yee are generally become infamous? What ſhall I ſay more? ye haue ſinned againſt Chriſt his chiefe Vicar, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Iudge and Iuſticer, by your diſobedience, that with</hi> Samuel <hi>the Prophet we may ſay:</hi> Quaſi peccatum, &amp;c. <hi>as a thing of</hi> ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying <hi>it is, to repugne; and as the offence of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>not to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be quiet. See I pray you, that ye are nothing better then</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers <hi>and</hi> Idolaters. <hi>And becauſe yee haue not heard the Church, while ſhe ſpake vnto you by the chiefeſt Biſhop, yee are as</hi> Ethnickes <hi>and</hi> Publicans. <hi>And here I make an end, earneſtly deſiring the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mightie God, that he will yet at the last giue you his grace, leſt that being thrust into ſempiternall destruction with</hi> Ethnicks <hi>and</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters <hi>you ſuffer immortall paines for this your diſobedience and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall.</hi> Thus farre <hi>F. Liſter</hi> the Ieſuite. And was it not neceſſary, that there ſhould be ſome <hi>ſtop put, or bridle to this licentious and ſcandalous proceeding?</hi> was there not danger that the <hi>good might hereby be infected?</hi> nay is it not euident, that many a good ſoule hath bene infected, and many alſo of the <hi>ſtrongeſt troubled</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? and had not then the Prieſts iuſt cauſe to declare vnto the world, how the caſe ſtood with them in England: and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſome reaſons of their actions, eſpecially when after the peace made, and all iniuries forgiuen by them, the Archprieſt did not onely not checke theſe <hi>licentious and ſcandalous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> of the Ieſuits, broched afreſh by them, but gaue them his hand in this action, and incontinently publiſhed this <hi>licentious
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5209:36"/> and most ſcandalous libell,</hi> which neither hath the authors name, nor is likely euer to be iuſtified. <hi>We haue receiued a reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from our mother citie, that the refuſers of the appointed authoritie were</hi> ſchiſmatikes. <hi>And ſurely I would not giue abſolution to any, that ſhould make no conſcience thereof, &amp;c. And therefore my direction is, that they make account thereof, and doe make ſatisfaction, before they receiue the benefite of abſolution.</hi> Can this <hi>Apologie-maker</hi> find any ſuch matter in any of the bookes, which he doth impugne, and terme <hi>licentious and ſcandalous proceedings?</hi> or can he ſhew, how <hi>the good</hi> could be ſo <hi>dangerouſly infected,</hi> or the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>troubled</hi> by any thing which the prieſts haue written, as they may be with theſe treatiſes, reſolutions, or <hi>libels</hi> of the Ieſuits and Archprieſt? with what face doth this author carpe at the prieſts bookes, and ſay, that the ſtyle is <hi>moſt bitter and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and nothing ſauouring of that ſpirit, that ſhould be in the ſeruants of one God?</hi> Could there be more <hi>bitter</hi> ſpeeches, then theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vttered againſt the prieſts? or is there any one in thoſe bookes which he impugneth, comparable to thoſe which this fellow himſelfe vſeth againſt the prieſts in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> calling them <hi>children of iniquitie,</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to his Holines; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Libertines,</hi> and other ſuch like, as the ſpirit moueth him? But theſe his tricks, not being to be taken by any man of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to proceed out of great exceſſe and paſſion, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereby more likely then the prieſts to be condemned, he propoſeth certaine generall conſiderations to trouble his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Reader:</hi> For example: <hi>What manner of men theſe be, that haue aduentured to be the authors of ſo intollerable a ſcandall in our Engliſh Church: what may be their motiues: what their ends: what their meanes, by ſecret combining themſelues with the enemie, for defaming ſuch, as they most feare and hate: and finally, what may be doubted in the ſequell: &amp; how diſunited theſe men be from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſuperiours, and conſequently from God alſo, as iustly may be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: yet for better enforming the Reader of diuers particularities falſly and vniuſtly ſet downe in their late bookes, or infamatorie</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, <hi>which I ſuppoſe the more pious ſort of men will haue ſcruple to reade or looke vpon, we are, &amp;c.</hi> A notable inſinuation, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt liſten to him and his partners, and muſt not once looke vpon any thing which the prieſts alledge for themſelues.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5209:36"/> And this caueat was very neceſſarily put in here, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to that policie, out of which the <hi>Edicts</hi> proceeded, that no man muſt ſee, what the prieſts could ſay for themſelues, leſt that the iugling of their aduerſaries ſhould be ſeene by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and they reduced to thoſe, to whome in the end they muſt adhere, when the true cauſes of all this diuiſion are to be ripped vp and iudged.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>diſcreet reader</hi> would but enter into the firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which is here propoſed vnto him, that is, <hi>what maner of men theſe be,</hi> his diſcretion will inforce him to heare them. For ſome of them are of the moſt ancient Prieſts in England: ſome haue ſuffered long impriſonment, &amp; were neuer touched with any thing blame-worthy, before this controuerſie began. In the time of greateſt need theſe men haue bene of thoſe, who haue moſt imployed themſelues in all parts of England, and what hath bene praiſe-worthy done in any diſputations at any time with the Proteſtants, it hath bene by ſome of them. This therefore, and the like contemptible ſpeeches, as Cap. <hi>9. fol. 119. ſuch as they be,</hi> and ſuch like, do argue nothing, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable pride in this Author: who being inferior to many of them for many good parts in them, vſeth a little liplabour (the beſt qualitie which he hath) to diſgrace them. In which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he will haue bad ſucceſſe with a <hi>diſcreet Reader,</hi> and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himſelfe and his fellowes, to haue bene <hi>the Authors of this intolerable ſcandall in our Engliſh Church.</hi> The ſecond conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration here propoſed to the <hi>diſcreet Reader</hi> is; <hi>what may be their motiues.</hi> And for this the <hi>diſcreet Reader,</hi> if he wil (as diſcretion would leade him) looke into their bookes, hee will finde that their <hi>motiues</hi> were, to ſhew how badly the Ieſuits, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt haue dealt with them; and how vniuſtly they haue bene defamed of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and other enormous crimes, as before is ſhewed: and that <hi>the end</hi> which they deſire is, peace, when the trueth ſhalbe knowen, which ſo long as it is ſmothered vp, can neuer breed peace. And thus is the next conſideration at an end, which was <hi>what their ends were.</hi> Now followeth, <hi>what their meanes are, by ſecret combining themſelues with the enemy.</hi> But firſt he muſt haue told the <hi>diſcreet Reader,</hi> what <hi>enemy</hi> this was. The prieſts neuer tooke other for <hi>enemy,</hi> then what they iudged <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:5209:37"/> hauing alwayes honoured the perſonages of ſuch, as to whom they do owe honour. And if this haue bene now lately perceiued by our Prince, and the State, and thereupon they haue ſhewed ſuch fauour vnto them, as faithfull and loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects do, or may deſerue (notwithſtanding the controuerſie in Religion) how doeth this fellow call it <hi>a combining with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?</hi> If the prieſts had at any time done any thing, which they are not ready to iuſtifie at the feet of his Holines, this good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low might haue caſt ſome odde ſurmiſe into his Readers head: but the contrary being ſo euident, as the world is now a witnes, the <hi>diſcreet Reader</hi> need not ſtand any longer vpon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, nor vpon the next: which is, <hi>what may be doubted in the ſequell:</hi> they hauing in this aſwell as in any other thing, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues no otherwiſe, then hath become Catholicke prieſts. Laſtly the <hi>diſcreet Reader</hi> muſt conſider <hi>how they are diſunited from their lawfull Superior, and conſequently from God alſo.</hi> A ſimple conſequence: but well beſeeming the charitie with which this <hi>Apologie</hi> was written. What bad man in authority wil not thinke himſelfe much bound to this Author for this his conſequence? Muſt he conſequently be iuſtly ſuſpected to bee <hi>diſunited from God,</hi> who ſhall not runne wholy with his <hi>ſuperior?</hi> Cannot a <hi>lawfull ſuperior</hi> do amiſſe? and in that miſdoing may he not be forſaken by thoſe, whoſe ſuperior he is, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring a iuſt ſuſpition, that they are <hi>dſunited from God?</hi> Haue not the prieſts oftentimes offered to haue theſe matters ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and determined (by which the diſunion hath growen) with all ſubmiſſion? And hath not the Archprieſt refuſed this offer, and written backe againe vnto them, that <hi>their petition is a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous complaint?</hi> And how then can they be ſaid, <hi>to be diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their ſuperior,</hi> and not rather the ſuperior from them? and he in refuſing to doe that which is honeſt and iuſt, is more <hi>diſunited</hi> perchance <hi>from God,</hi> then he taketh himſelfe to be, or thoſe who direct him in theſe his ſtrange courſes. After theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations foloweth a faire promiſe to bring forth <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proofes</hi> of ſuch matters, as are, or ſhould here be handled. But, they being not yet ready, the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt content himſelfe, with what this Author can at this time affoord him, and hope to ſee ſomewhat in a larger <hi>Apologie.</hi> And he will performe this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5209:37"/> in a farre other ſtyle, then the prieſts vſed in their bookes, <hi>if God aſsiſt vs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with his grace and holy Spirit.</hi> A very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſuch as would gladly be ſeene in any of his actions, and his fellowes: who (both in their <hi>Libel,</hi> which was ſpread abroad vnder <hi>F. Liſter</hi> the Ieſuits name, &amp; in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> yea almoſt immediatly after this godly reſolution) are ſo farre from <hi>Chriſtian ſpirit,</hi> or ordinary <hi>modeſty,</hi> as it could not but be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioy to all their friends, to ſee any iot of <hi>Gods grace</hi> or <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> of his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> in them. But as it ſeemeth by the latter end of this preface, there is ſome kinde of reſiſtance made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this <hi>aſsiſtance of Gods grace and holy Spirit.</hi> Where this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour faigning vnto himſelfe, that theſe bookes againſt which he writeth, could not be publiſhed in the ſtyle they goe in, <hi>by any modest and Chriſtian ſpirit,</hi> he concludeth that they are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <hi>by ſome one, or few diſcompoſed paſsionate people, or by ſome heretike, &amp;c. and ſo as to ſuch, we ſhall anſwere</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and not to our brethren:</hi> yet doth his anſwere throughout all the <hi>Apologie</hi> light vpon <hi>the Prieſts,</hi> although indeede the termes which are vſed, would much better fit <hi>an heretike</hi> againſt <hi>an heretike:</hi> ſo little doe they ſauour either of <hi>modeſtie,</hi> or <hi>Christian ſpirit.</hi>

For hindring whereof, he hath tried all his poſsible meanes, as before we haue noted: but eſpecially that of diuiſion, emulation, and contention hath bene his chiefest. For by emulation of the Nobility against the Clergie, and of Secular prieſts againſt religious, he raiſed</hi> Iohn Wickliffe <hi>aboue 200. yeeres paſt, whom</hi> Iohn of Gaunt, <hi>Duke of</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>ſonne to King</hi> Edward <hi>the 3. together with the reſidue of his faction (vpon emulation he had with B.</hi> Arundel <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>B.</hi> Wickam <hi>of</hi> Wincheſter, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) did ſet vp, and maintaine againſt thoſe and the reſt of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: eſpecially againſt religious men, that had poſſeſsions:</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe <hi>being a Secular prieſt himſelfe.</hi> Thus ſaith this author: and then he goeth forward, affirming how that <hi>certaine motions were made concerning the taking away of the Abbey lands, &amp; giuing them to the Crowne: which motions were made vpon the ſame emulation
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5209:38"/> vnder the Kings,</hi> Richard 2, Henry 4, Henry 5, <hi>and others: and tooke effect in the time of King</hi> Henry 8.

But as it ſhould ſeeme, he was neither Monke nor Frier, but <hi>talis qualis,</hi> ſuch as he was, or as other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance who came after him, although they follow him not in all things: For as it appeareth in our Chronicles, hee preached againſt Monkes and other religious men that had poſſeſſions, and taught ſuch doctrine, as hee was condemned for it in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> as an heretike, and his bones were taken vp and burned, as is beforeſaid. Whereby alſo this authour is proued to forget himſelfe very much, to number him amongſt the Clergie, which is generally taken for ſuch, as are not onely in Orders, but liue alſo in vnitie of the faith.

To theſe falſhoods, and couert calumnies againſt the <hi>Secular</hi> Prieſts, this deceit of this author may be added, That whereas the Chronicles doe mention, that not only <hi>Iohn Wickliffe,</hi> but foure doctors of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie alſo (one of euery Order of the begging Fryers) ioyning with him, were imployed by <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> in his grudge againſt <hi>Biſh.

Moreouer, it ſoundeth very fooliſhly, that <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> would ſet <hi>Iohn Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kliffe</hi> againſt the Monkes, vpon an <hi>emulation</hi> which hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops, their eſtates depending ſo little vpon the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5209:39"/> eſtate of the Monkes: as when all the Abbyes in England were put downe, the Biſhops remained in as great honour as euer they did. And wheras it is further ſaid, that <hi>the Abbey lands were taken from the Monkes, and giuen to the maintenance of the crowne by the ſame emulation of the Clergie againſt the Religious in the time of K. Henry the eight,</hi> it is moſt falſe: the Abbyes being then put downe by a change of Religion, which had not the beginning vpon any ſuch emulation as this author affirmeth, but vpon the perſwaſion of <hi>Longland</hi> B. of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Kings confeſſor, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Card. <hi>Wolſey,</hi> viz. that his Highneſſe mariage with the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> his brother Prince <hi>Arthurs</hi> wife, was vnlawfull and againſt the word of God: whereby the King being indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeeke a diuorce, but croſſed therein with the Pope by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, nephew of the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> and ſome others, as well of the Laytie as the Clergie, both <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> here in England, it wrought in the King ſuch a diſlike of his Holines, and others, as it procured not onely the ouerthrow of the Abbyes, but ſuch a change in Religion, as ſince the world hath ſeene. Of this alteration therefore, if any <hi>emulation</hi> were the beginning, it was an <hi>emulation</hi> in the Cardinall (who dealt with B. <hi>Longland,</hi> to perſwade the King, as is mentioned, and afterward did ſecond him with all his might himſelfe) againſt the Emperour, for hindering him of the Popedome: and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>ſiſter,</hi> nor the <hi>mother</hi> to ambition (as this author would haue it) but her <hi>daughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greateſt folly committed by this author in this his <hi>exordium</hi> is not yet touched: and that is, that among all other hiſtories impertinent to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie in queſtion, he would make his choyſe of one wherein himſelfe (if we are not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) is notoriouſly diſciphered. <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> was a Secular prieſt: being a prieſt, and neither Monke nor Friar: and no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſt as differing from them in habit, and conuerſing with the religious Mendicants, vnder pretence of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. His followers tooke no name of him, as both Monkes and Friers do of their founders, and Sectaries of their Maſters: but went vnder the name, which the common people gaue them, to wit, <hi>Lollards.</hi> He was vſed as an inſtrument by <hi>Iohn of Gant,</hi> to bring that to paſſe which this Duke had long concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5209:40"/> in his mind. <hi>For he ſaw</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorie) <note place="margin">Ioh. Stow. ſup.</note> 
                  <hi>that it would be hard for him to obtaine his purpoſe, the Church ſtanding in his full ſtate, &amp;c. Wherefore he laboured firſt to ouerthrow aſwell the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> And to this end did <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> beſtow his talents: <hi>for he was not onely eloquent</hi> (ſaith the hiſtorie) <hi>but alſo ſeemed to contemne temporall goods for the loue of eternall riches, &amp;c.</hi> This authour, being in a ſtate which once was of Secular prieſts, now no ſtate of Secular prieſts: not becauſe he will be taken for either Monke or Frier, or goe barefoote as <hi>Iohn Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe</hi> did and his followers, or baſely clothed (for theſe are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mortifications) which of what edification ſoeuer they are, yet are not worthy of that honour, which is due to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mortifications, which lie hid, and are not ſeene by the corporall eye. But becauſe Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it: yet ſo as he being <hi>filius populi</hi> (as people ſay) hath no other name, but what the people giue him, he is imployed not by <hi>Iohn of Gant</hi> himſelfe in his owne perſon (for this great Duke died aboue 200 yeeres ſince) but by <hi>Iohn of Gant</hi> in ſome of his poſteritie, who hath ſomewhat to bring to paſſe, which he hath long conceiued in his mind: for the effecting of which, this godly Father is buſied in the corrupting the Cleargie of England, or the vtter ouerthowing it: which at this preſent, he and his doe worke by taking from them their good name and fame, and making them odious without iuſt cauſe, to the people. And to the end that he would be knowen not to haue ſpent his time idlely in <hi>Wickliffe</hi> his ſchoole, he hath not onely imployed his tongue, but his pen alſo: and in his firſt platforme of <hi>Reformation</hi> hath ordeined, that <hi>none of the Clergie ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe any temporall liuings, but ſhall liue vpon ſuch penſions, as ſhall to certaine of his company and ſome ſecular Prieſts (ioyned with them) in their wiſedome ſeeme neceſſary for their maintenance.</hi> But let vs now ſee whether this authour can fit himſelfe better in the next point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of this Queenes dayes, the little affection which the Laitie did beare vnto the Clergie, procured by ſome vnquiet ſpirits, as alſo the ſmall vnion of diuers Clergie men among themſelues, ſome holding with the heretikes and politikes by beate of faction, was a great occaſion of the totall ouerthrow of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5209:40"/> whereupon alſo the ſame deuill brought in the diuiſion of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, about going to the hereticall Churches and ſeruice, which moſt part of Catholikes did follow for many yeeres: and when the better and truer opinion was taught them by Prieſts and Religious men from beyond the ſeas, as more perfect and neceſſarie, there wanted not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that oppoſed themſelues, eſpecially of the elder ſort of Prieſts of Q. Maries dayes. And this diuiſion was not onely fauoured by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but nouriſhed alſo for many yeeres, by diuers troubleſome people of our owne, both in teaching and writing.</hi> See how ſhamefully he followeth ſtill this bug <hi>emulation.</hi> If the <hi>little affection in the Laitie towards the Clergie,</hi> and <hi>litle vnion amongst the Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> were then culpable, what reward muſt they haue, who now haue effected the ſame to the ouerthrow of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which by the great paines of many religious Prieſts, hath gotten root in many? But to our purpoſe. It is euident that no <hi>emulation</hi> was cauſe of the change of the Catholike Romane religion, profeſſed in her ſiſters time, but her Maieſties conſcience, I muſt thinke: her Highneſſe hauing bene euer trained vp, both in her fathers, and brothers times, in the religion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and following to that purpoſe the counſell of ſuch as thought not ſo well of the Church of Rome, as of the Religion that is now profeſſed, <note place="margin">Io. Stow. in Eliz. An. 1. 1559.</note> as may appeare by ſuch actes as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred to haue bene done preſently vpon her Maieſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crowne. But as for the <hi>Catholikes their going to the Church,</hi> it was ſomewhat more to be lamented perchance, then to be blamed, before it came to be a <hi>ſigne diſtinctiue,</hi> by which a Catholike was knowen from one, who was no Catholike. For this conſideration onely in the iudgement of the Ieſuites in their Romane Colledge, made the going to Church vnlawful in England, as we haue heard M. <hi>Iames Younger</hi> (afterwarde Doctor of Diuinitie) affirme, who preſented vnto them the diſcourſe, which <hi>Bell</hi> made in defence of going to the Church with a proteſtation.</p>
               <p>It is alſo well knowen that Fa. <hi>Boſgraue</hi> the Ieſuite, at his firſt comming ouer into England, went to Church, vntill hee vnderſtood, that now it was become a <hi>ſigne diſtinctiue,</hi> and was excuſed for that fact by his ignorance of the then preſent ſtate of our Countrey: himſelfe comming from ſuch places, where
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5209:41"/> it was not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſo heinous a matter to go to the Proteſtants Church. F. <hi>Alexander</hi> &amp; his felow Ieſuite may much more fitly be ſaid in the ſpirit of this author, to be the deuils inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in Scotland, by <hi>bringing in a diuiſion of opinions</hi> about going to the puritanical aſſemblies, after that the Catholikes there had been inſtructed by the <hi>ſecular</hi> prieſts of the danger therof, &amp; forbore thoſe meetings: wherby it was become alſo there a <hi>ſigne diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue.</hi> But whenſoeuer any troubleſome of any ſort hath either in teaching, or writing nouriſhed this, or any other diuiſion, bending this way, the <hi>Secular</hi> prieſts haue ſhewed themſelues moſt vigilant &amp; conſtant in the defence of vnity, and the ſafety of our Engliſh Church: as it very well appeared by M. <hi>Io. Muſh</hi> his labours againſt <hi>Bell</hi> in the North: his &amp; M. <hi>Watſons</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Catholikes in Scotland againſt thoſe Ieſuits, Fa. <hi>Alexander</hi> &amp; his felowes: &amp; the ſtanding againſt Fa. <hi>Walley</hi> and Fa. <hi>Southwel,</hi> (two Ieſuits) in the South by M. <hi>Collington,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnock,</hi> when theſe Ieſuits did teach the Catholikes (who were called to the barre openly at Aſſiſes or Seſſions, in the yeere 1591) that they might lawfully (to keepe themſelues out of priſon, for not going to the Church) yeeld to goe to this or that learned Proteſtant to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre with him in matters of their faith: which could imply no other (at the leaſt in the face of the world) then a doubt of their faith, or a contentment to be inſtructed in their faith by ſuch, as in their conſcience they tooke for heretikes: and conſequently it was a deniall of their faith before men, if this axiome keepe his old authority: <hi>Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in fide eſt infidelis: He that is doubtfull in his faith is an infidell.</hi> But after all this trouble was ended, Fa. <hi>Southwell</hi> (as we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) imployed M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> to tell M <hi>Charnocke,</hi> that hee was now of mind, that it was a thing vnlawfull. And Fa. <hi>Walley</hi> told M. <hi>Collington</hi> that his meaning was onely, that the Catholikes ſhould go to the houſes of the learned Proteſtants, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with them, but rather as a temporall puniſhment, to quit them from going to priſon: which how ridiculous a ſhift it is, any man of meane vnderſtanding may eaſily perceiue, and alſo what kinde of people they were, whom it was likely the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell did moſt fauour, if they would debaſe themſelues to deale in ſuch offices, as the Author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> doth here affirme.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5209:41"/> And thus much for his ſecond paſſage.</p>
               <p>The third matter which here he affirmeth is, that certaine Catholicks liked not, that the Catholicke Engliſh Clergie ſhould be reſtored at the leaſt by way of a Seminary, which was begunne at <hi>Doway.</hi> which becauſe it paſſeth my capacitie, I will not enter into, further then this; that they were ſtrange Catholicks, of what nation ſoeuer they were (that Seminary not hauing any rule, by which the Students were bound to any thing more, then to ſtudie Diuinitie, after which they might diſpoſe of themſelues as they would) but this Author ſaith, that thoſe Catholicks their letters are yet to be ſeene: and perchance they will come foorth with the larger <hi>Apologie,</hi> and giue credite to this ſo ſtrange an aſſertion. In the meane while this Author <hi>will goe forward with the narration of thoſe hurts and difficulties, which vpon emulation haue fallen out in this our Engliſh cauſe vnder the Queene that now is, eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Seminaries, &amp;c.</hi> But firſt as it ſhould ſeeme the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt haue a pipe of Tobacco, for that his ſtomack is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous full: and before he can come to this narration, he muſt diſgorge himſelfe. Hauing therefore told his Reader, how that ſome Catholicks were againſt the reſtoring of the Engliſh Clergie (as is before ſhewed) thus he eaſeth himſelfe: <hi>And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the principall and onely ground of this our preſent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſcandalous controuerſie, is the very ſame diſeaſe of</hi> emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>partly of Lay men againſt Prieſts, and partly of Prieſts againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men (eſpecially the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>with whom at this preſent they haue to do) and that this</hi> emulation <hi>is accompanied with apparant wicked ſiſters and daughters, as Ambition, enuie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, contention, malice, pride, malediction, and other like: it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing for our brethren and others, to diſcerne, from what root theſe buds doe ſpring: and conſequently, either to auoyd them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or that other men be carefull to take heed of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See I pray you, what lothſome ſtuffe here is: and ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily ſet downe, as it doeth moſt liuely repreſent the knowen old medicine to kill fleas, by putting duſt in their mouthes. If but halfe of theſe matters here alledged were proued againſt the Prieſts, doubtleſſe they were to be auoyded by Catholicks, as ſuch as wanting no faults in themſelues, would hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5209:42"/> others in vertue. But this Author being not as yet ſetled to his <hi>Apologie,</hi> without doubt diſcouereth that hee is not free from all thoſe vices, which he hath reckoned (if he want any of them) who vpon ſo ſmal, or rather no cauſe, or euidence, would haue his Reader to enter into ſo raſh, and vile a iudgement of the <hi>Secular</hi> prieſts, as though his <hi>Apologie</hi> were to no purpoſe, vnleſſe his Reader would carry ſuch an vncharitable conceit of them, as there ſhould be no need of any <hi>Apologie,</hi> or defence of thoſe who are their aduerſaries. But now to his ground of this preſent contention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The principall, or onely ground</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of this our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſcandalous controuerſie, is the very ſame diſeaſe of</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>partly of Lay men againſt Prieſts, and partly of Prieſts againſt religious men: eſpecially the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>with whom at this time they haue to doe, &amp;c.</hi> We haue before ſhewed that the <hi>emulation of the Laitie againſt the Cleargie</hi> (of which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth before) was, for that the Cleargie were thought to be an hinderance to ſome deſignments of the Laitie: and thereupon ſome few deuiſed how to indomage the Cleargie.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5209:42"/> oftentimes, and thruſt alſo ſome Secular Prieſts into the action (although moſt grieuouſly againſt their wills) namely in the yeere 1596.

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:5209:43"/> which alſo (as I weene) he will not ſay: eſpecially, that he is <hi>a Ieſuit,</hi> as hee expoundeth himſelfe, or a <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Societie,</hi> with whom at this preſent (as he ſaith here) <hi>they</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>haue to doe.</hi> For at this he laughed, Num. 16. in his <hi>table of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</hi> But perchance his ſtrayning to diſgorge himſelfe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a lightnes in his head, that he knew not well what hee ſaid. The filth then before ſhewed, being now out of his ſtomacke, <hi>For better declaration of this matter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall goe forward with the narration of thoſe hurts, and difficulties, which vpon</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>haue fallen out in this our Engliſh cauſe, vnder the Queene that now is, eſpecially concerning the Seminaries, and the reduction of England by that way, and meane procured, for theſe 20. yeeres, and more: to wit, ſince the beginning of the Romane Engliſh Colledge, which was in the yeere 1578. at what time a contention beganne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene</hi> M. Doct. <hi>Lewis then Archdeacon of</hi> Cambray, <hi>but after B. of</hi> Caſſana, <hi>and the Engliſh ſchollers, about the maner of gouernment, and gouernors of that houſe, erected eſpecially by his procurement, and induſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath ſhewed you before, what hurt came to England by the <hi>emulation</hi> which ſome Catholicks had againſt the reſtoring of a new Engliſh Clergie at <hi>Doway,</hi> which notwithſtanding, the Seminary there floriſhed: and afterward alſo at <hi>Rhemes</hi> in France in ſuch ſort, as England (thankes be to God) did not feele that hurt, vntill new Lords came, who were of the Ieſuits faction, and were forced ſometime to runne with them, for ſome reſpects, how ſmal ſoeuer their inward deuotion was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Now he will giue you to vnderſtand what great hurt our Engliſh cauſe hath had by <hi>emulation,</hi> which was at Rome. And becauſe he will take all before him, he ſaith that Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> (after B. of <hi>Caſsana</hi>) and the ſchollers fell out about <hi>the maner of gouernment and gouernours of the houſe,</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if this fellow had any reſpect to the good reputation of the Schollers, hee would haue concealed, the houſe being <hi>ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, eſpecially by that man his procurement and induſtry,</hi> as here it is confeſſed. For in reaſon, who would not haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to haue borne ſome ſway in that of which he might iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue bene called in ſome ſort a founder, being moreouer a man of great wiſedome and integritie? But this Author
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5209:43"/> thinketh it good policie, to conceale <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> preſence at Rome at that time, leſt that the riddle ſhould be read other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then hee would haue it, and the cauſe of diſſenſion diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered. The trueth is, that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> was there, and there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no more to be ſaid. And hee did deale with the ſchollers vnder hand, &amp; as ſecretly as he might, but failed of the Rector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if he ſought it: although T.W. in his <hi>digreſsion from the 16 martyrs, pag. 53.</hi> amongſt other his follies doth affirme, that <hi>the firſt Rector of this Colledge was F.</hi> Robert Parſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to ſay that <hi>the Councell did lay hands preſently, hoping thereby to keepe a perpetuall diuiſion in our nation,</hi> is to argue the Councell of a great ouerſight, and want of conſideration, that a diuiſion in a nation prooueth oftentimes a deſolation or vtter ouerthrowe thereof. But let vs ſee what ſubſtantiall proofe there is of this aſſertion: <hi>For which cauſe</hi> (ſayth this Author) <hi>diuers ſpies were ſent ouer to nouriſh the ſaid diuiſion, as namely one</hi> Vanne <hi>(if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well) who died in the Inquiſition at Rome in the yere 1581. and ſoone after they vſed another named</hi> Salomon Alread, <hi>a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor by his trade, and married firſt at</hi> Lyons <hi>in France: but after get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting acquaintance at Rome, and Millaine, hee became a ſtateſman, went in and out diuers times to the Councell of England, vntill at laſt being diſcouered, he remained for ſeruant with Sir</hi> Fran. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham <hi>the Q Secretarie: and laſtly, profeſsed hereſie. Vanne</hi> is ſaid to be employed by the Counſell, to nouriſh this diuiſion in our nation; but what hee did, it is not ſaid: this the reader himſelfe muſt imagine: neither is it ſaid, with whome he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when he came to Rome, or with whom he dealt: onely it is ſaid, that he dyed in the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> which argueth that hee was ſome obſtinate heretike. And this example is as fooliſhly brought, to prooue <hi>emulation in the Laytie againſt the Clergie,</hi> as that of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> was to prooue <hi>emulation of the Clergie against the religious,</hi> both being heretickes: and conſequently neither of them of that body, of which we are to vnderſtand this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor when he talketh of the Laytie and Clergie, vnleſſe he will alſo take that word <hi>Religious</hi> to extend it ſelfe to ſuch Apoſtata Ieſuits, as are either at <hi>Geneua,</hi> or elſewhere. And then will hee make himſelfe ridiculous in affirming, that <hi>emulation</hi> againſt ſuch religious ſhould hinder the reduction of England to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5209:44"/> Cath. faith. <hi>Salomon Alread</hi> was a Catholike, and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote of the Ieſuits, both at <hi>Lyons</hi> in France and elſewhere. And if by his peuking, he did at any time diſcouer what he receiued of them, this author (who neglecteth the credit of all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to ſaue the Ieſuits credit) ſhould haue couered it, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing named any place of this mans conuerſation, where hee ſhould <hi>become a Stateſman,</hi> but ſuch as where the Ieſuits were his directors, as <hi>Lyons</hi> in France, <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Millaine.</hi> And if after the edification he had of the Ieſuits, he returned into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and offered his ſeruice to Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Secretarie, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> had little reaſon to refuſe him, or not to imploy him, although we cannot learne that euer he did any harme in the Engliſh Colledge at Rome. And therefore this example of <hi>emulation</hi> in the Laytie againſt the Clergie, is as ſmall to the purpoſe as the former. His being a <hi>Taylor</hi> might perchance make to the purpoſe in this authors conceit; but his being <hi>a married man,</hi> is doubtleſſe here mentioned, for no other end then to put vs in mind, that married men can play the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants as well as others: as if wee had forgotten, that as the Councell did ſecond the Ieſuits (who were not maried) in the firſt diuiſion at the College of Rome by ſending <hi>Vanne</hi> thither, (as this author ſayth) who was an vnmarried man, ſo did the Ieſuits ſecond the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels imploiment of this <hi>Solomon Alread,</hi> (who was maried) in the furthering of their faction in the ſame Colledge at Rome, by entertaining <hi>Pierce</hi> amongſt ſome other ſtraglers, who was alſo a married man, and his wife knowen to be liuing, to make vp a ſmall number of 8. or 10. pious youths, (as the Ieſuites did terme them) to ſtand with them againſt all the reſt of the ſtudents in the Colledge: yet in this one tricke the Ieſuits went beyond our Councell, in that they made their married man <hi>Cornutus,</hi> by putting him in a ſquare cappe, the better to effect that which they did by his means. For this was he, who after many deuiſes, preuailed at the laſt with three of the Students, to go to a Tauerne to drinke, where they were no ſooner ſet, then apprehended by the <hi>Sbirri.</hi> And the matter was made ſo odious, as hereby they loſt the fauor of his Hol. &amp; were brought into a moſt ſeruile ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Ieſuits, not without the great grief of their friends, who long after complained, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5209:44"/> they had very euill handled a good cauſe. And although theſe were the firſt ſtratagems, which were layd open to the world: yet were diuers cauſes giuen of diſquietnes, euen from the firſt foundation of that Colledge: For the Ieſuits hauing gotten the gouernement thereof into their hands, and in ſuch ſort, as they were moſt earneſtly requeſted thereunto by ſuch, as (howſoeuer this Author doth bragge of them, <note place="margin">Chap. 5. fol. 28.</note> and their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to his Holineſſe) confeſſed not long after, that <hi>they knew not what they had done;</hi> they began to ſtrike (as we ſay) while the iron was hot, and laboured a couple of the Students to become Ieſuits, to wit, <hi>Thomas Wright,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Barton,</hi> who were well eſteemed of for their towardlineſſe. And although both of them did afterward leaue the ſocietie of the Ieſuits: yet their preſent example, together with the Ieſuits bad indeuours, was occaſion of much diſunion of mindes in the Colledge: which when it was perceiued, the Ieſuits the better to noriſh this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; to couer their owne dealings, imployed ſuch of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in that office, as had already deuoted themſelues vnto their ſocietie: and did countenance them againſt thoſe, who complained thereof: inſomuch as it was too apparant, that ſome were of purpoſe deferred, or kept from going into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the Ieſuites, to the end they might perſwade others to the ſame courſe, which was in deed the vndoing of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For now the Students did not know, how to diſcerne one of their owne fellowes from the Ieſuits, which began to ſwarme amongſt them; and grew in the end to that malapart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as they laughed, and ieſted at the Students to their faces: yet muſt all be accounted the worke of the ſpirit. And if this ſpirit were at any time found, then to bleare the Students eyes, it was deuiſed, that no man did perſwade any to leaue the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to become Ieſuits: but did onely eleuate the mindes of ſuch good wits, as were capable thereof, to a deſire of ſome higher ſtate of perfection: In which when they had once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, and that the ſtudent was now reſolued thereupon, and conſequently to leaue that courſe in which he was, by being a member of the Colledge, they did the more boldly aske this queſtion, why the Student, minding to leaue the Colledge, and betake himſelfe to a ſtate of greater perfection, or ſecurity,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5209:45"/> might not be exhorted to be a Ieſuite rather then of any other order of religion. By which poore ſhifts the Ieſuits were often diſcouered, that they ſought their owne honour more, then the good, either of the Colledge, or of our countrey: both which, through theſe occaſions, haue come pretily forward to vtter ruine. And theſe were the troubles, which this Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth in this <hi>Apologie, cap. 11 fol. 170.</hi> although he would ſeem to ſmother them vnder a much-making of M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> who was a principall inſtrument of the Ieſuits in this diſturbance of the Colledge, <hi>and he is not aſhamed to obiect to the Fathers</hi> (ſaith this author) <hi>their partialitie towards ſome, more then towards other, and all this to draw yong men to their ſocietie, whereas in the former we know by experience, and can teſtifie that no other thing euer wrought the</hi> Fathers <hi>more trouble in the Colledge, while this man was there, then their ouer much loue and fauour to him aboue his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as other men thought, and yet was not this to draw him to their ſocietie, ſeeing they would not admit him in ſo many yeares, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to enter, foreſeeing (as may be thought) his perillous nature, &amp;c.</hi> His ſeruice we may ſee how much it was worth vnto him: he was kept out, as many are, in all places where there are Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites; becauſe being Ieſuits, they cannot but with too great a wracke of modeſtie, ſo inordinately commend them, as they muſt be commended, nor, without demonſtration of exceſſiue deſire of riches, importunate others, to giue them ſuch lands, and goods, as are not to be loſt for want of asking, which while no Ieſuits do hunt after, they are thruſt vpon them (good men) and with all charity are imbraced, with moſt godly intention, to be beſtowed <hi>in pios vſus.</hi> But it ſhall be alwayes in the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites choice, to receiue ſuch a purueyor into their order: and he muſt during life be in a ſeruile eſtate, ready to attempt, what they ſhall commaund him (for their intreaties are alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements) or els he ſhall be turned going with his liuery. <hi>They would not admit him, foreſeeing (as may be thought) his peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nature.</hi> But to leaue ſuch fooles in their expectation of a like reward, after ſo many yeres better ſeruice to them, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Countrey (although wee make no doubt, but ſome thinke they doe well, and that all is gold that gliſtereth) we will returne to examine that which followeth concerning the great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5209:45"/> harmes, which this authour hath eſpied to haue come to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, through <hi>emulation</hi> (as hee pretendeth) of others: but leaſt theſe two, to wit, <hi>Vanne</hi> and <hi>Alread,</hi> ſhould not ſeeme enough, to conuince <hi>the great hurt, which hath come to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by emulation of the Laity againſt the Clergie,</hi> this author inculcateth to his reader, that the Councel ſtil purſued this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſtirring diuiſion between the followers of D. <hi>Allen,</hi> and D. <hi>Lewis,</hi> for both whom he doeth here giue his word, that it was much againſt their willes, although not long after <hi>fol. 5.</hi> he calleth the one an emulator of the other. But to let this paſſe, and to beare with this poore man, whoſe memory ſeemeth to be very greatly ouercharged with this <hi>Apology,</hi> we muſt alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>this plot of the Councel was much holpen by a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: and that was, that certaine Gentlemen, hauing once ioyned (as it ſhould ſeeme with D.</hi> Allen, <hi>Fa</hi> Parſons, <hi>and Sir</hi> Francis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefield, <hi>and the reſt of the body of Catholikes at home and abroad, in certaine affaires of our Countrey, parted ſometime from them: and by going another way, among other inconueniences thereupon enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ouerthrew the Queene of Scots.</hi> A proofe to ſerue a poore turne, &amp; very impertinent in this place: yet ſuch, as were it not a diſcredit for wiſe men to take aduantage of a madde mans words, it were ſufficient to call all Cath. in queſtion, and thoſe affaires, what they were, in which <hi>the whole body of them aſwel at home as abroad,</hi> were vnited, eſpecially it being here mentioned, that the <hi>going of ſome another way was the Queene of Scots her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow.</hi> But rather then theſe fellowes will lacke matter, they will tell a hundreth idle tales, with litttle regard what danger may come to thoſe who are vpon ignorance wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>About this time alſo,</hi> (ſaith this authour) <hi>and ſoone after, diuers impugnations were attempted at Rome againſt the Seminaries and miſsions of England by men of oppoſite ſpirit and</hi> emulation. But here is not ſhewed, what hurt came vpon this <hi>emulation,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrariwiſe it is ſhewed, that there came no hurt. And if there had come any, yet had this bene farre from his purpoſe, vnleſſe he did ſhew it to haue bene an <hi>emulation</hi> in the Laitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Clergie, or in the Clergie againſt the religious. <hi>And not onely lay men, but diuers Prieſtes alſo, brought vp in the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:5209:46"/> (ſaith he) <hi>were drawen by little and little to be of this faction againſt D.</hi> Allen, <hi>Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>and the Ieſuits: and namely ſome in Rome, as appeareth by a viſitation, yet extant ſent to the Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege by Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>in the yeere 1585, &amp;c.</hi> At this time, as we are informed, there was a viſitation. And if thoſe men ſhould be named, who were then noted for factious, the Ieſuites would ſtartle, and many of their friends. But vnleſſe ſome cauſe be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of deſcending to more particulars, wee will ſay no more, then that the principall (then accounted) of the faction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming afterward into England, and not finding amongſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſts any, who would conſent with them in ſuch their factious humours, are become Ieſuites: in which eſtate they may hope to keepe themſelues at the leaſt in vre for that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Other ſome although they doe not profeſſe to be Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, yet they ſticke ſo cloſe vnto them, as <hi>aio</hi> doth to <hi>aiunt, nego</hi> to <hi>negant.</hi> And for ſo much as we can learne, that <hi>emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was not againſt D. <hi>Allen:</hi> for as it appeared very well, he was ſo much honoured by them all, as at his worde the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of them, and who is now a Ieſuit, made publique ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in expreſſe words acknowledged his errour, in that he had not ſo long a time obſerued that ſaying, <hi>Qui neſcit diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulare, neſcit viuere: he that knoweth not how to diſſemble, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to liue.</hi> How farre foorth <hi>M.D.B.</hi> (noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) was a cauſe of that viſitation, I know not: but if we doe not miſtake the man, hee was ſent into England long before this viſitation came to the College. And as for the other two Prieſts, whoſe names are ſet in the margent in this ſort, <hi>G G.E.G.</hi> who are ſaid to haue conſpired with the Councell in England, and for more grace, and gratification, haue writ two miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous bookes, <hi>the one</hi> (ſaith this authour) <hi>againſt D.</hi> Allen, <hi>the other againſt F.</hi> Parſons <hi>and the Ieſuites, giuing them vp to</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham <hi>the Queenes Secretarie, affirming alſo among other points, to make the parties more odious (as our men their ſucceſſours doe at this day) that theſe men depended of Spaniards, and were enemies to their Countrey:</hi> We heartily wiſh that this authour may liue in as good credit as the one of them liueth, after all his trouble in Italy, or elſewhere, and die as penitent as the other died, after his troubles in France. He who writ againſt the Ieſuites, was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5209:46"/> too priuie to their actions, aſwell in England, as elſewhere to be deceiued in them. And if the Appellants be the men, whom here this authour meaneth by theſe words, <hi>their ſucceſsors,</hi> they may purge themſelues very well from any offence in hauing the like thought. For it is well knowen, that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> in Spaine cauſed many aſwell others as Prieſtes to ſubſcribe, as prieſts, to the title of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> now Dutches of <hi>Burgundie. Fa. Tancard</hi> alſo hath made many to ſet their handes to three blanks, although ſome refuſed to do it, as they haue themſelues reported, at their returne into England. We haue moreouer vnderſtood, that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> was a chiefe dealer in the ſending of thoſe Armadoes which the Spaniards haue ſet out for the inuaſion of our Countrey: and there are in England, with whome hee dealt moſt earneſtly, to goe in the Nauie which was ſet out in the yeere 1596. who, refuſing to be imployed in any action againſt their Countrey, were for that cauſe ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the College, &amp; told, that it was not conuenient that they ſhould ſtay in the College, where they had giuen exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch repugnance. There is moreouer ſufficient proofe, that after the euill ſucceſſe of the Spaniſh attempts, <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> carried a youth to the king of Spaine, who pronounced a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpeech for the purpoſe, which being ended, <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> began to vrge the king to giue one attempt more, affirming that he (ſilly fellow) would write his letters into England, and nothing doubted to effect, what ſhould be to the great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuch a iourney. We haue alſo certaine intelligence, that the Ieſuites had deuiſed a meanes, to haue had the tower of London ſeazed into their hands, and how they would haue it held vntil the Spaniard came to reſcue them. Diuers of their letters haue bin ſhewed to diuers priſoners for proofe againſt them, when they haue anſwered in defence of the Ieſuites, that they thought them free from ſuch ſtratagems. And amongſt the reſt, there is one of the 10. of <hi>Iune 1596.</hi> wherein there are theſe wordes: <hi>It may be, if the kings faintneſſe and puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hinder vs not (as heretofore it hath) the Armado will be with you about Auguſt, or September. This is one good helpe, Ireland wilbe onely for vs. The Earle of</hi> Tyrone <hi>and</hi> Odonell <hi>would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue helpe from hence, and they are well contented to let the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5209:47"/> haue certaine holdes and forts for their vſes. This will greatly pleaſure to trouble and diſquiet England, and in the mean time ſerue for harbour for the ſhips, that ſhall paſſe that way, &amp;c. It were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary you ſhould make it knowen aforehand, that no Cath. man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall take harme, either in body or goods. Let euery man be quiet till the Spaniards be landed, then ſhall there preſently proclamation be made of all ſecuritie.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There were 200. copies of theſe proclamations printed in Spaine.</note> Certaine other letters alſo haue bene ſeene of <hi>Fa.

                  <hi>But not beeing able to preuaile in this againſt the Card himſelfe,</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>they began to ſet more earnestly againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits his chiefeſt friends and constant defenders, as well in ſtirring vp the ſchollers in Rome against the Fathers that gouerned them, as alſo to make a faction againſt them by Secular Prieſts in England; as may appeare by a letter of the Cardinals owne, written most earnestly not ſixe moneths before his death to a prieſt named</hi> Muſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a ſpeciall Treatiſe comming forth, of the troubles of that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Engliſh Colledge, to which I am to referre the Reader, and to note no other thing in this place, then that the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours of the Ieſuits was the cauſe of all thoſe troubles.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5209:47"/> as all England may witneſſe: and there is a letter extant of M. <hi>George Blackwell</hi> (the now Archprieſt) wherein hee inueigheth mightily againſt thoſe, who had made the report, that the prieſts and Ieſuites were at ſtrife. <note place="margin">Ianuary 1596. to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I cannot tell vpon what diſcontentment, &amp;c. But whereof ſoeuer it commeth, it is of the enemie, and with all poſsible diſcretion and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by the wiſer ſort on both ſides to be rooted out, or els it wil be the ruine of the whole cauſe, &amp;c. And therefore in this point (eſpecially M.</hi> Muſh) <hi>be earnest and peremptory with all parties, and euery one in particular, &amp;c.</hi> By which we vnderſtand not, how it may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be gathered, that there was a factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Secular prieſts againſt the Ieſuits, then that there was a faction by the Ieſuits againſt the Secular prieſts: neither is here any relation to any former ſpeech had with him, as doubtleſſe there would haue bene, had M. <hi>Muſh</hi> giuen any ſuch information to him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, as may be gathered by theſe wordes: <hi>I haue heard to my great griefe, &amp;c.</hi> which argueth, that this was put into his head by ſome other, that this being before layd for a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they might afterward build thereon to their owne beſt liking, nothing at any time being accounted ſo much their honor and glory, as others falling out: which howſoeuer they doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand nouriſh it, while they would ſeeme to remedy it, maketh them wiſe and charitable purueyours for the common cauſe, and what not (good men) beeing as innocent of theſe broyles and diuiſions, as <hi>Sinon</hi> was of the betraying of <hi>Troy.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it may appeare by this letter, that the Car. had a very great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5209:48"/> good conceit of M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> who would employ him in a matter in which lay <hi>the ruine of the whole cauſe:</hi> and therefore willed him to be <hi>earneſt, yea and peremptory with all parties.</hi> His good affection was alſo ſhewed, in that at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into England, he perſwaded the Pope, to giue vnto him very ſpeciall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and power to name, at his returne into England, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number, who <hi>hoc ipſo</hi> ſhould haue the like. And yet this author is not aſhamed in this place, to ſet downe to his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit theſe words: <hi>Hauing bene with the Cardinall at Rome, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done ſome euill offices, as is preſumed, &amp;c. the Card. perceiuing his humour, wrote moſt effectually to him, and by him to others againſt this diuiſion and faction, but little preuailed.</hi> And in the margent there is a note of the aboue cited letters, which as they are ſet downe in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> are a moſt abſurd inſtance to proue thus much, as is here preſumed of the Cardinals ſiniſter conceit of M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> as that it was farre from trueth, which was auowed, that <hi>the Cardinall was diſunited from the Fathers before he died.</hi> For thus this author maketh his tale hang together: <hi>But it litle preuailed, as now appeareth: onely it may ſerue to prooue how falſe and farre from trueth it is, which he</hi> (M. Muſh) <hi>and others of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doe auow in their bookes, that the Cardinall was diſunited from the Fathers before he died: for that he ſaid, as they relate, that when he ſhould be dead, farre greater troubles and oppoſitions would fall out againſt the Ieſuits: which may be true, for that he ſaw ſo much</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>againſt them, by Libertines and factious people, already begun in his time, which yet were reteined ſomewhat from breaking forth by this authoritie while hee liued.</hi> But the Cardinall liuing yet ſixe moneths longer, what proofe could this letter be, that hee was not <hi>diſunited from the Ieſuits before he died?</hi> Or what proofe is it of any ſuch vnion to the Ieſuits, when he writ it, as it could not be likely, that hee was diſunited, before he died he willeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Muſh</hi> to be <hi>earneſt and peremptory with all parties:</hi> in which words the Ieſuites are included, aſwell as the Secular prieſts, and conſequently the Cardinall was peremptorily conceited, that ſomewhat was amiſſe in the Ieſuits, or elſe hee would not haue bene ſo bold with them, as he might (vpon any ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) with the Secular, of whom he had a particular charge. To our remembrance alſo the words of the Cardinall related
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5209:48"/> vnto vs, were not thoſe which are here cited, to wit, that when he was dead, <hi>farre greater troubles and oppoſitions would fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ieſuits;</hi> but, that there would be very great troubles by the Ieſuits their ambitious courſes &amp; bad carriages towards the Secular prieſts. And this gloze, that he foreſaw ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation againſt them <hi>by Libertines and factious people,</hi> is piouſly made by this authour, that the reader ſhould be out of doubt what <hi>ſpirit</hi> it is which doeth <hi>aſsiſt</hi> him in the making of this his neceſſary <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the good Cardinall being dead in the yeere 1594 all factions</hi> (ſaith this fellow) <hi>brake out together againſt the Ieſuits, deſtitute now of the Cardinals aſsiſtance, &amp;c.</hi> This Author miſtaketh the matter: For after the Cardinals death, the Ieſuits began their raigne in euery place, where any Engliſh were reſident, as at Rome, and in England, eſpecially at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> where, through the folly of the Lay Catholicks, they had greateſt hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile firſt, and afterward to haue an eaſier conqueſt of the reſt. The ſtirres &amp; troubles of Rome are particularly to be ſet downe in a diſcourſe thereof, whither wee are to referre the Reader. The ſtirres in England began at <hi>Wisbich</hi> by the inſolencie of the Ieſuits there in durance, <hi>F. Weſton, F. Buckley, F. Bolton</hi> and others, who had deuoted themſelues particularly to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or paſſed their vowes in ſecret. And to effect this the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Lay gentlemen, by whoſe charitie the Caſtle had bene relieued, were dealt withall by the Ieſuits, or their factious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, to withdraw their charitie from all thoſe, who would not ſubiect themſelues to <hi>F. Weſton</hi> the Ieſuit, by whoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions it is moſt falſly here auowed, that the company had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>a Collegiall and religious maner of life:</hi> for before hee came thither they liued indeed in ſuch ſort, but after his comming, his ambitious humor diſturbed the whole houſe, as it is ſet downe in a booke already publiſhed of <hi>The ſtirres at Wisbich.</hi> And as for the ſtirres, which were in the Low-countries, the cauſe is here in patt ſet downe by the Author of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> to wit, that <hi>Fa. Holt,</hi> and <hi>M. Hugh Owen</hi> were deemed partiall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome, and did not further them for the getting of their penſions. But as it ſhould ſeeme theſe two had ſome intent, in which becauſe thoſe other would not ioyne with them, they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5209:49"/> were accompted as factious, and not worthy of the Spaniſh charitie. <hi>F. Holt</hi> was ſufficiently knowen to haue bene a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious actor in the yeere 1588. and was not without cauſe thought, through his folly, to haue bene the cauſe of the death of the duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> His treacherie was afterward better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, in his imploying of <hi>Hesket,</hi> who was executed at <hi>S. Albones</hi> for his ſeruice done to the ſame <hi>F. Holt</hi> the Ieſuit, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the plotters of the raiſing of the noble <hi>Ferdinand Earle of Darby</hi> to the Crowne of England, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Stanley,</hi> and other ſuch like. After which the good <hi>Earle</hi> likewiſe enioyed his life but a little while, but died an vntimely death in the prime of his age. How farre forward this <hi>Owen</hi> alſo, mentioned here, might be in theſe actions, we leaue it to men of vnderſtanding; he being pew-fellow with <hi>F Holt</hi> in the Engliſh affaires, as it ſhould ſeeme by this Author. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine letters of his of the 5. of <hi>April 1596,</hi> doe ſhew euidently, that he was a dealer with the Spaniſh faction againſt England. And whereas this Author, among other his impertinent ſtuffe, doeth here gird at the dimiſſion of <hi>M.D.B.</hi> out of the Engliſh Colledge at Rome, to quit perchance the ſtory of that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expulſion of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> out of <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford:</hi> he hath made his anſwer to this, and ſet it to M. <hi>D. Ely</hi> his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie.</hi> But this is alſo here to be noted, that he was ſent into England very honourably, and was admitted into the <hi>ſodalitie</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> which was at that time a fauour ſo ioyned with thoſe, who were eſteemed well of by the Ieſuits, as if any of that <hi>ſodalitie</hi> had bene factious, or behaued themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their liking, they were expelled, or reduced to a kinde of Nouiceſhip, as ſome Ieſuits in England can teſtifie. This alſo is certaine, that the viſitation, of which there is mention made in this <hi>Apologie</hi> to haue bene about that time, was long after his departure, vpon an open breach, and parts-taking in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, betweene the Ieſuits, and many of the Students.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning <hi>Iohn of Gaunt, Iohn Wickliffe, the diſſolution of Abbeyes in the time of King Henry the 8: the Q. Mary Prieſts: the going to Church: the</hi> emulation <hi>against the inſtitution of the Seminaries: the dealings of the Counſell by ſpies, to further the diuiſion begun in, and for the Seminaries: the parting of ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5209:49"/> from</hi> D. Allen, F. Parſons, Sir Frances Englefield, <hi>and the whole body of Catholicks vnited in certaine affaires of our Countrey: more matters against the Seminaries: the writings of</hi> G. G. <hi>and</hi> E. G. <hi>againſt</hi> D. Allen, F. Parſons <hi>and the Ieſuits: the hinderance of</hi> D. Allen, <hi>when he was to be made Cardinall, and the ſetting vp of his</hi> emulator: <hi>and the breaking foorth of all factions againſt the Ieſuits in Rome, Flanders, and England.</hi> Now we ſhall come to more domeſticall affaires. And firſt of all we muſt vnderſtand that <hi>Fa. Parſons comming to Rome in the yeere 1597, made an end of thoſe ſtirres, which were betweene the Engliſh ſtudents, and the Ieſuits:</hi> which we are not here to examine, but referre the Reader to the particuler diſcourſe, which is made thereof. That which concerneth vs here, is the bold and vnſhamefaſt aſſertion of this Author, who to make a lewd entrance into a like relation, he telleth his Reader that the aſſociation which was begun in England by the Prieſts, was deuiſed by the relicks of the troubleſome, which <hi>F. Parſons</hi> had after his comming to Rome acquieted. Theſe are his words, <hi>But the relicks of thoſe that had bene troubleſome, and vnquiet before comming into England, and conferring againe with their conſorts of their former actions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements fruſtrated as they thought by</hi> F. Parſons <hi>dealing at Rome, reſolued to begin againe, but after another faſhion, (to wit) by deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a certaine new Aſſociation among themſelues, with offices, and prelacies of their owne inſtitution, where unto meaning to be choſen by voyces of ſuch as they would procure to fauour them, his Holines ſhould be inforced afterward to confirme them, &amp;c.</hi> What is it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which this audacious companion will not aduenture, who ſo ſhameleſly will report a matter controllable by all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in England, who can witnes, that this <hi>Aſſociation</hi> was begunne long before the yeere <hi>1597,</hi> and conſequently before <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> came to Rome, as may apparantly be gathered out of this place of the <hi>Apologie?</hi> Yea <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> himſelfe (as good proofe will bee made) had vnderſtanding of this <hi>Aſsociation,</hi> when he was in Spaine, and M. <hi>Iames Standiſh,</hi> who was one of the firſt dealers therein, was at Rome before <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> came thither. And could this fellow without a vizard publiſh, that it was <hi>deuiſed by the relicks of thoſe troubleſome</hi> (as hee termeth them) <hi>whoſe deſignements were fruſtrated (as they thought) by</hi> Fa.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5209:50"/> Parſons <hi>dealing at Rome?</hi> Is it not eaſily ſeene with what <hi>ſpirits aſsistance</hi> this is written, when as this very ſame Author in the ſame booke <hi>Ca. 7. fol. 89.</hi> turneth this matter to M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> and an other vpon his returne from Rome, &amp; the death of the Card. which was in the yeere 1594 and <hi>fol. 90.</hi> bringeth witnes of his owne, that it begun about 4. or 5. yeres before a letter dated the 2. of <hi>May</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 1601? And <hi>fol. 96.</hi> the examination of <hi>Fiſher</hi> conuinceth moſt plainely, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun before his being returned backe out of England in the yeere 1597 as appeareth <hi>fol. 93.</hi> Moreouer, that which here in generall termes he calleth <hi>offices and prelacies of the Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> in the 7. Chap. <hi>fol. 90,</hi> he calleth <hi>a ſuperioritie, as it were of Archbiſhops, the one for the South, the other for the North,</hi> which if it had bene ſo, was no <hi>prelacie of theſe Prieſts inſtitution,</hi> as all Chriſtendome will witnes. But there was no ſuch matter, as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> his pen will witnes, which was vſed to proue, how inconuenient it was for one to haue ſo great a charge: neither can this Author proue, that euer there was any thing intended, but an order or rule, vnder which who would, might liue, and thoſe who would not, might chuſe. And there is aſmuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> Cap. 7. <hi>fol. 90</hi> where wee finde in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſixe Aſſiſtants to the <hi>Nuntius</hi> in Flanders of the 2. of May 1601, that there were Chapters in the new conſtitutions of the Aſſociation of thoſe that are <hi>to bee admitted, or expelled;</hi> Which is a demonſtration that this fellow enlargeth himſelfe too farre beyond the trueth in this point, as alſo when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that thoſe <hi>relicks of the troubleſome at Rome</hi> deuiſed <hi>a new Aſſociation</hi> in England <hi>with offices and prelacies of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as if they were Archbiſhops, the one for the North, the other for the South,</hi> as Cap. 7. he explicateth himſelfe, and addeth here in this place a ſtranger conceit, then was in all the reſt, that is, <hi>that his Holines ſhould be inforced afterward to confirme them.</hi> For how this force ſhould be offered to his Holines, we do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: eſpecially if it were true (as it is as far from the trueth, as that which we haue already ſhewed) which <hi>fol. 90.</hi> is ſaid, that this Aſſociation was to the preiudice of others. And that the moſt part of our brethren reclaimed, and miſliked the ſame, as <hi>ſauouring both of preſumption, and ambition.</hi> But let vs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5209:50"/> as the trueth was, that as many, as were moued in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (either Ieſuits, or Secular prieſts) liked ſo well of it, as ſome of them affirmed, that the onely feare they had was, that it was too good a motion to goe forward (hauing perchance had ſome experience of their owne peruerſeneſſe, or of others, who now exclaime againſt it) ſome that it was the beſt plot that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was deuiſed: yet could not this be any <hi>inforcement to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe to confirme it,</hi> vnleſſe this author will acknowledge ſuch a right in the prieſts to chuſe their ſuperiour, as the thruſting one vpon them, without their priuitie, muſt bee taken for a wrong done vnto them, which (we hope) he will not ſay. But we will leaue this fellow to explicate himſelfe howe <hi>his Holineſſe ſhould</hi> haue been <hi>enforced to haue confirmed ſuch as the prieſtes ſhould haue choſen to the offices or prelacies, and as it were Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and we will examine that, which followeth, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily affirmed, that <hi>the prieſts were working againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, whom</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>they had procured at the very ſame time by a man ſent ouer to this purpoſe into Flanders, to be accuſed to his Holineſſe in a moſt odious, and infamous</hi> Memoriall, <hi>as ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, that will gouerne them againſt their willes, &amp;c.</hi> But this could neuer be proued as yet againſt thoſe, who were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of the <hi>aſſociation,</hi> although perchance ſome of thoſe in <hi>Wisbich</hi> might ſend ouer ſuch informations, as the ambition of Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> the Ieſuite, &amp; others his parteners might giue cauſe in that inſolent <hi>Agencie</hi> which was to bee erected in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> whereunto many in England cannot, without a deſperate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie denie, that both they were ſolicited, and perſwaded, that when they ſent their almes to the reliefe of the priſoners in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> all thoſe prieſts who would not ſubiect themſelues to Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> the Ieſuite, ſhould be excluded from hauing any part of their <hi>charity</hi> (as they wrongfully termed it) And one of this godly <hi>Agencie</hi> at <hi>Wisbich</hi> (breaking forth with the conſent of the reſt, to imploy the vtmoſt of his talent in this their nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation) being asked by a Gentleman, with whom he had dealt to this purpoſe, what ſhould become of thoſe who would not ſubiect themſelues to the Ieſuits gouernement, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <hi>Starue them.</hi> The lamentable diuiſion which was made by the Ieſuits, and their aſſociates in that action, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5209:51"/> ſcandall of all our Countrey, doeth alſo conuince, that the Ieſuites, <hi>as ambitious men, would gouerne the prieſts against their willes:</hi> there being no other cauſe of that publike ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both at boord, and in their other conuerſation, then the not yeelding of ſome to become ſubiects to Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite. By which it appeareth that the <hi>Memoriall</hi> in this part was neither <hi>ſlanderous,</hi> nor any way <hi>falſe,</hi> as here it is affirmed, but moſt true and iuſtifiable, and no prieſt who had any care of his credit, or conſcience, could write otherwiſe to his Holineſſe. True it is, that the Ieſuites laboured mightily to haue all the prieſts to ſet to their hands to certaine letters or propoſitions framed by them againſt a <hi>Memoriall,</hi> which they themſelues ſpread abroad here in England, and tranſlated it into Engliſh, that all ſorts of men, women and children might ſee their goodneſſe. And they got many prieſts to ſet their hands, ſome to a letter to this effect, that <hi>vpon their owne knowledge all was falſe, which was contained in the Memoriall:</hi> (a teſtimony, which none but God himſelfe could giue, if it had bene ſo, for it required that ſuch a witneſſe was to be preſent at all times, in all places, with not onely one of thoſe Ieſuits, but with them all, in how ſeuerall, or diſtant places ſoeuer they were, and muſt be priuie to all their actions) others the Ieſuits got to ſet to their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to this point, that <hi>not knowing any of theſe articles to be true, they did think that all were falſe:</hi> An act both of exceeding pride, and raſhnes in preiudice of ſuch as were ſayd to haue bene the authors of that <hi>Memoriall,</hi> to wit, M. D. <hi>Gifford,</hi> and M. <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> and ſuch like, to whome theſe ſubſcribers &amp; the ſoliciters were much inferiour for their reputation, and place in the world, and could not without great iniurie (being ſo informed) giue ſuch a teſtimony, eſpecially vpon ſo weake a ground, as <hi>not knowing:</hi> being bound in modeſtie to know, that there were many things, both true and iuſtifiable, which they did not know, and how eaſily all malefactours would be cleerely purged from all heinous crimes whatſoeuer, if the witneſſe of all, who could not, or would not accuſe them, were to bee regarded, or taken as currant, againſt a farre leſſe number of accuſers. But neither were theſe ſubſcriptions voluntarily made: for they were exacted with grieuous comminations
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5209:51"/> and threatnings: yea, and ſome muſt ſubſcribe without reading that to which they were willed to ſubſcribe, or their ſubſcriptions deferred vntill the time would better ſuffer the gatherer of the hands, to let the ſubſcriber ſee, vvhereunto he muſt ſet his hand: which what could it argue other, then that there was ſomewhat to be teſtified, which they, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, thought in their own conſciences, the Prieſts would not teſtifie, if they might be ſuffered to read it? And in this ſort was M. <hi>Iohnſon</hi> ſollicited to ſubſcribe, as himſelfe did at that verie time relate to ſome of his brethren. And it is very probable, that <hi>Fa. Garnet</hi> the Ieſuit intended ſome ſuch matter, when wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to M. <hi>Collington</hi> to requeſt him to ſet his hand to a letter, which M D. <hi>Bauand</hi> had written, and to procure likewiſe M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> hand, and M. <hi>Heburnes</hi> to the ſame, he would not let them ſee what M.D. <hi>Bauand</hi> had written: but being asked the letter, to which he would haue had theſe ſet their names, he returned anſwere, that it was already ſent away: which could argue no other then a fetch to get their conſents to ſubſcribe to ſuch a letter, by vertue of which conſent, he would haue ſet their names vnto it, and they ſhould haue teſtified, they knew not what. The good dealing alſo in gathering names againſt this <hi>Memoriall</hi> was preſently after ſhewed, by the falſifying of the Archprieſts inſtructions. For in this heate the authoritie was procured and appointed, as may be prooued by the date thereof, which is 7. <hi>Mart. 1598. Apol. cap. 8 fol 102.</hi> And the firſt of theſe teſtimonials beareth date 24. <hi>Mart. 1598. fol. 98. Fa. Garnet</hi> fayling of his purpoſe, of getting theſe mens hands in that ſort, as he wiſhed (for although he gaue them libertie to pen a letter of their owne, if they would, yet his requeſt to haue their hands ſet to a letter already drawen, but not to be ſeene by them, as the euent prooued when they ſent for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth his good meaning what it was:) there was (amongſt other forged inſtructions, and falſely inſerted among thoſe which were ſent vnto the Archp. from Rome) this inſtruction made, that euery one ſhould ſet his hand againſt that <hi>Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> And this did the new Archprieſt, euen when he was taken in the maner of falſifying his inſtructions, ſo vrge vpon <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> when he ſent for them, to make knowen
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5209:52"/> his authoritie, as he threatned them grieuouſly, if they would not ſubſcribe againſt it, affirming that they ſhould anſwere this their bearing off from that action, in ſome publike Court, where they ſhould repent it. Afterward alſo it was ſo followed, as <hi>M. Henry Henſlow</hi> was imployed to perſwade them, where <hi>M. Collington</hi> was then reſident, to turne him out of their houſe. And he performed his office with ſuch immodeſt termes, and with ſuch extreme fury, as he well diſcouered, whereunto this new authoritie did tend. And thus much to ſhew, that it was farre ynough both from <hi>ſlander</hi> and <hi>falſhood,</hi> which was ſaid of the Ieſuites their indeuours, <hi>to gouerne the ſecular Prieſts againſt their wils,</hi> and how they did canuaſe for names againſt the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall,</hi> and preſſed the Prieſts ſo farre, as they were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vſe figures (as ſome of them haue ſince confeſſed) to ſatisfie the importunitie of the Ieſuites and their factours. This alſo is here to be remembred, that the man named to haue bene <hi>ſent ouer by the Prieſts into Flanders to accuſe the Ieſuites,</hi> was not ſent by them, but returned thither, from whence he was ſent into England, to vnderſtand whether the Ieſuits did vſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no better in England among the Prieſts, then they did at Rome among the Engliſh Students: for to this ende he was imployed by the Card. <hi>Toledo</hi> (as he affirmed) and had letters to that effect of the Cardinal, who was much auerſed from the Ieſuits their actions in the College. And although he brought not theſe letters with him into England (which was a cauſe that many giue no credite vnto him) yet he brought ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thereof, and that he was imployed into England by the Cardinal, and could not returne any other anſwere, then what was moſt apparant by the diuiſion at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> that <hi>the Ieſuites as ambitious men would gouerne the Prieſts againſt their wils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When his Holineſse ſaw this manner of proceeding,</hi> ſaith this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, (that is to ſay, how he ſhould be inforced to confirme theſe Prelates which the Secular prieſts would haue choſen, and how the Ieſuites were ſlandered and purged by the moſt of the Prieſts in England) <hi>he willed the Card</hi> Protector, <hi>to call vnto him F.</hi> Parſons, <hi>and other Engliſhmen in Rome, to ſee what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie was beſt for theſe diſorders. They anſwered, that the only way which ſeemed good to them was, to giue them a</hi> Superior, <hi>or</hi> Prelate
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5209:52"/> 
                  <hi>of their owne Order, and to deliuer thereby the Ieſuites from theſe calumniations, which his Holineſse yeelded vnto, after diuers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes conſultations, &amp;c.</hi> Here then we are ſolicited to conceiue that the ground of this new authoritie, was his Holineſſe care to remedy the diſorders which he perceiued to be in England, by ſuch letters as were written vnto him: namely againſt this <hi>Memoriall,</hi> and that after diuers moneths conſultation, it was appointed. But we haue alreadie ſhewed ſufficient to prooue this a notorious falſhood. For as we haue prooued out of this <hi>Apo. fo. 98</hi> the firſt letters which were written to this effect, were written the 24 of <hi>March. 1598.</hi> which was after the Cardinals letter of the inſtitution of the Archprieſt, as appeareth by the date thereof, which was the ſeuenth of <hi>March, 1598.</hi> as it is to be ſeene <hi>fol. 102.</hi> and conſequently diuers moneths after that his Hol. is ſaid to haue entred into this conſultation, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this preſent place of the 1. chap. and in the 8. Chap. <hi>fol.</hi> 98. But perchance we tooke this author at the worſt, when we conſtrued his words in this manner, as though he had ſaid, that his Hol. had vpon theſe letters aduiſed vpon ſome ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; after diuers moneths reſolued vpon this: whereas this author, after mention of theſe letters, and other matters, ſayth only in this ſort, <hi>When his Holines ſawe this manner of proceeding, he willed the Cardinall, &amp;c.</hi> We are therefore to requeſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader to turn to the 8. cha. of the <hi>Apol.</hi> where no ſuch ſhift ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vſed to auoid this foule dealing. The cha. beginneth in this manner. <hi>When his Hol. heard the former ſtate of matters in England Flanders, and other places, and of the murmurations of ſome againſt the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> ſocietie, <hi>ſet downe aſwel in the aboueſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelious</hi> Memoriall, <hi>as by diuers other letters &amp; relations, which came to the</hi> Protectors <hi>ſight, and by him was related to his Holines, and namely when he receiued great ſtore of priuate and publicke let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters out of England againſt the ſaid</hi> Memoriall <hi>of</hi> Fiſher; <hi>and ſome one, with aboue 100. hands at it, other with 40. and 50. all in fauour and commendation of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>&amp;c. his Holines after mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration reſolued, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe hee will not come without his proofe, what cauſe his Holines had to inſtitute this ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or rather to giue order to the Cardinall for it, as hee ſayth, hee hath ſet downe in the margent a note of the letters,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5209:53"/> which cauſed this conſultation. <hi>See</hi> (ſayth he, in the margent) <hi>the letters of the Northerne Priests,</hi> 24. Mart. 1598. <hi>and others</hi> 20. Apr. <hi>and others after</hi> 30. Iul <hi>and others of the South in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 18. Maij, <hi>and of the quiet ſort of</hi> Wisbich 27. March 1598. and who without bluſhing can reade this, and take it as a cauſe of a determination vppon the 7. of <hi>March 1598.</hi> for then was the authoritie inſtituted, as is acknowledged, <hi>fol. 102.</hi> &amp; much leſſe of a conſultation diuers moneths before, as is here ſaide, <hi>fol. 7.</hi> And thus hee goeth forward with a certaine ſhameleſſe boldneſſe, not caring what he ſayth, knowing belike that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites will ſwallow any thing eaſily, which he propoſeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: yet doeth he too much forget himſelfe in this place, where he ſayth, that it was not thought expedient for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines to write himſelfe, for auoiding ſuſpitions and troubles of the ſtate of England: for by this he will ſufficiently purge thoſe prieſts of all diſobedience to the Sea Apoſtolike, who did not ſubiect themſelues to the newe authoritie vpon the comming of the Cardinals letters, by which the authoritie was inſtituted. But this is elſewhere ſufficiently handled, and prooued to be free not onely from <hi>ſchiſme or diſobedience,</hi> but from all ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, yea though it were true, that his Holines gaue full commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as here it is ſaide) to the Card. <hi>Caietane</hi> the <hi>Protector,</hi> to appoint the authoritie with conuenient inſtructions. For his Holines not writing himſelfe, as here it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, how ſhould the Prieſts take notice thereof, that it was his acte? which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Archprieſts miſdemeanour, in the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his new authoritie, &amp; other matters alſo, was the cauſe, why the Prieſts did at their great charges ſend to Rome two of their brethren, to haue dealt with his Holines about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But their Ambaſſadours comming thither</hi> (ſayth this authour) <hi>and ſhewing no deſire of peace or vnion at all, or to accept of any good condition to liue in obedience, &amp;c.</hi> And thus hee runneth with a free penne to auouch any thing which is for his purpoſe, how contrary ſoeuer it is to trueth. But becauſe this matter is at large handled by this author in the 9. Chapter of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> where alſo we ſhall declare how theſe matters paſſed at Rome, we will onely note here, that the two Prieſts had little reaſon to determine their buſineſſe with F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> D. <hi>Haddocke,</hi> or M.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5209:53"/> 
                  <hi>Martin Array,</hi> who perchance are the <hi>others</hi> which are here meant, and as it is here confeſſed fol. 99. were actors or conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the conſtitution of this authority, and parties directly oppoſite againſt the Prieſts in England. Beſides that, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which was offered by F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> was very ridiculous, to wit, that the two Prieſts, who with ſo great danger and charge were arriued at Rome in the behalfe of many other, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe into England with letters to the Archprieſt and Ieſuits, <hi>to amend what ſhould be yeelded by them to haue beene done amiſſe: &amp; to giue ſatisfaction vnto all men, where it was due:</hi> which if the Archprieſt and Ieſuites would not performe, the Prieſts might come againe out of England to Rome. And how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſoeuer <hi>F. Parſons</hi> thought himſelfe in this deuiſe, the two prieſts could not but thinke it would haue bene a great folly in them, to haue accepted this condition of peace, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance if they had vnderſtood his Holines mind, that he would haue entertained them, as they were entertained, with cloſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and other ſuch fauours (as ſhalbe ſhewed as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerueth) poſſibly they might haue returned againe into their countrey, and haue contented themſelues vntill it had pleaſed God, to haue taken ſome pitie vpon their miſeries. But to prooue how falſly this fellow affirmeth, that <hi>the two Priests ſhewed no deſire of peace and vnion,</hi> their going to the Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> (whome they tooke to be the ordeiner of the new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as theſe words of his letters did import) <hi>Dum haec no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra ordinatio durauerit: ſo long as this our ordinance ſhall endure:</hi> and there offer to bring him in writing, what they had to ſay, will be a ſufficient argument: which as it ſhould ſeeme, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and their faction, fearing leaſt by this meanes their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might come to light, procured (contrary to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals honour, who had entertained the Prieſtes in this cauſe) that they ſhould be committed cloſe priſoners, &amp; not ſuffered euer after to come together to deale in any thing, vntill ſome two or three dayes after, that there was a <hi>Breue</hi> giuen, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Archprieſts authoritie: which being obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon the 6. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> as the <hi>Breue</hi> beareth date, the two Prieſts were ſuffered vpon the 8. of the ſame moneth to come together, &amp; the <hi>Breue</hi> being preſently brought vnto them, they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5209:54"/> yeelded themſelues, as well in the name of their brethren, as in their own, promiſing to obey it, &amp; doubtles were ready enough to haue ſworne it, if his Holines had exacted any ſuch thing at their hands, after that he had declared what his wil was ſhould be done, what reaſon ſoeuer the prieſts had to the contrarie. But the trueth is, that there was no oath taken, nor any deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This might therefore haue been left out with more truth then inſerted in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> to wit: <hi>this was promiſed at that time of all hands, and the two meſſengers did ſweare it alſo by a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall oath:</hi> as alſo that epitheton to the <hi>Breue,</hi> to wit, <hi>new:</hi> for what doth this import other, then another <hi>Breue,</hi> as though ſome <hi>Breue</hi> had been before made, and refuſed by the prieſts? which is a moſt vntrue conceit, yet neceſſarily to be made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words of the Apology, <hi>He</hi> (the Pope) <hi>confirmed all that was done already by the Cardinal with</hi> a new Breue. <hi>This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed at that time</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>of all hands, and the two meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers did ſweare alſo by a corporall oath, and hope was, that all would be quiet hereupon, to which effect Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>alſo wrote very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and pious letters vnto M.</hi> Collington, <hi>and M.</hi> Muſh, <hi>and they accepted kindly of the ſame, as after wee ſhall haue occaſion perhaps more particularly to ſet downe. But now Sathan being loth to haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ended, began again to ſet them out in England, and to put them in worſe caſe then euer, by the induſtry of certaine ſeditious humors of the chiefeſt contenders, whereof ſome deuiſed newe iniuries offered them by the</hi> quiet, <hi>ſome required ſatisfaction for the old &amp;c. vntill in</hi> Nouember <hi>laſt 1600. diuers of the diſcontented made a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre doth he imbolden himſelfe, as who hauing no intention to bee any way accounted a changeling. Wee will here omit, that which he affirmeth of <hi>Fa. Parſons pious letters to M. Collington, and M.

Cannot Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> praiſes euen in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5209:54"/> matters of ſmalleſt moment be ſounded by lip, or regiſtred by pen, but with moſt groſſe falſhood, <hi>thus wrote F. P.</hi> (that is, a <hi>courteous and pious letter,</hi> as here it is declared <hi>fol. 8.</hi> for it beareth the ſame date, and is written to the ſame men as may be ſeene) <hi>euen then when yet the Popes</hi> Breue <hi>was not come forth.</hi> And leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould doubt of this <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> his <hi>courteſie</hi> or <hi>pietie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time of the comming forth of the <hi>Breue,</hi> he proueth it by the date of his letters which he ſayth is the ninth of <hi>April,</hi> and the date of the <hi>Breue</hi> which he ſayth is the 21. of <hi>April.</hi> A manifeſt falſhood, as may bee ſeene both by the <hi>Breue</hi> it ſelfe, and by many places in this <hi>Apologie:</hi> where it is ſet downe to beare date 6. <hi>April</hi> 1599, as in the ſame tenth chapter <hi>fol. 140:</hi> and immediatly before in the end of the ninth chapter, and els where. So that I cannot but marueile at the fooliſh greedines of this author, in taking euery occaſion to commend Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> how vntowardly ſo euer it fadgeth with him. <hi>But Sathan being loth to haue ſedition ended, began againe to ſet them out in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and to put them in worſe caſe, then euer, by the induſtry of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſeditious humors of the chiefeſt contenders &amp;c.</hi> Theſe were the Ieſuits and the Archprieſt: firſt the Ieſuits, namely Fa. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who after the peace made, gaue out, that they, who ſhould hold opinion <hi>dogmatizando,</hi> that the prieſts were not <hi>ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,</hi> ſhould incurre the cenſures of holy Church, which the Archprieſt did not onely not controll being told thereof, but bare the Ieſuit out in his wicked aſſertion. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more publiſhed a reſolution, which he ſayd hee had receiued from the mother citie, by which the prieſts were condemned, as <hi>ſchiſmatikes.</hi> and it was high time for the prieſts not onely to complaine of intolerable iniuries, but to ſeeke for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo in ſuch places, where they were by theſe meanes defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which when it would not be granted, they made an offer to come to diſpute the caſe, with promiſe moſt humbly to aske pardon of the Archprieſt, and the Ieſuits, if it could be proued, that they had been <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> and deſire to be reſtored to their good name, if in caſe they could not be proued to haue been ſuch. But this offer of diſpute was alſo reiected, and they were threatned, who ſhould goe about to defend their good names, thus moſt vniuſtly harmed. whereupon they ſent to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5209:55"/> of <hi>Paris,</hi> that by the reſolution of learned men, ſuch as they imagined a company of punie felowes would haue regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this queſtion might haue bene ended. But when theſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſaw this reſolution for the prieſts, they were worſe then euer they were, and the Archprieſt did forbid all ſorts vpon grieuous penalties to maintain <hi>that reſolution by word, or writing, directly, or indirectly, whether it were giuen vpon true information, or otherwiſe.</hi> as though thoſe learned men hauing true informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the Archprieſt here ſuppoſed) were ſo much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, as no man without incurring grieuous cenſures, might defend their opinion, in the queſtion propoſed: for theſe are the words of the decree, made by the Archprieſt <hi>29. Maij 1600 whether it be truely giuen, or forged, whether vpon true information, or otherwiſe.</hi> And theſe proceedings of the Archprieſt compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the prieſts to make their Appeale to his Holines, which beareth date the 17 of <hi>Nouember</hi> 1600. And it was made not onely for them who ſet their names vnto it, but for others alſo, who ſeeing the affliction which hung ouer the ſecular prieſts, and fearing (not without iuſt cauſe) that their turne would come afterward, were deſirous of redreſſe, but dared not to ſhew themſelues in the action, in reſpect of the hard meaſure which they ſaw offered to their brethren, who were in actuall perſecution by the Ieſuits, and Archprieſt. And when this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie</hi> was publiſhed in England, it was knowen, that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publiſhing thereof, the prieſts were gone ouer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Appeale; and had preſented themſelues before the <hi>Nuntius</hi> in Flanders, who was in commiſſion, as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to determine this matter.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be ſayd, that the booke was printed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus much was knowen, this anſwere alſo may be made, that in the like caſe, where an vntrueth was printed in the 12. Chapter <hi>fol. 201.</hi> they did find a meanes to clap on a piece of paper, that it ſhould not bee read, being a relation no more falſe, then this was. But if they ſhould haue taken this courſe throughout the booke, to haue paſted paper, where there were vntrueths vttered, there would haue been very little to haue read in the Apologie. And therefore perchance they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued rather to aduenture all their credit at once, by letting
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5209:55"/> the booke goe vncorrected of thoſe falſhoods, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, then not to do the harme which they intended. The like folly and falſhood alſo is that, which is here inſerted of M. <hi>Charnocks</hi> Appeale: for as we had ſufficient teſtimony from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeas, his Appeale was proſecuted in due time: and moreouer, that he was long ſince freed from the ſentence of the two Cardinals.</p>
               <p>And wheras it is furthermore ſayd, that M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſentence of two Cardinals, after that he had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and ſworne to the obſeruation thereof, it is moſt vntrue; for no oath was euer demanded of him, concerning that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It was onely ſhewed by Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> firſt to him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who had his liberty foure or fiue dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſentence was ſeen. And all the oathes, which were taken, were taken by <hi>Acariſius</hi> the Fiſcall, when M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was deliuered out of priſon: which acte of the <hi>Fiſcals</hi> was of none effect, as not hauing Commiſſion to do any thing in that cauſe, as <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> affirmed, when hee ſhewed this ſentence of the Cardinals, alleaging for proofe, out of the ſame letters, that the declaration of the Cardinals mind was committed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Vicerector of the Engliſh Colledge. But of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the falſhood vſed therein, we ſhall haue occaſion to write more at large in anſwere to the ninth chapt. And while theſe Appeales did and doe hang, all obedience is ſhewed, which may bee ſhewed without preiudice of the Appeale, or which is to be vſed to notorious detractors, and vnconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defamers of Catholike prieſts. Neither is there any other libertie, or freedome ſought for by any, then ſuch liberty as belongeth to Chriſtians, and of the which Catholike prieſts are moſt vnchriſtianly depriued, and they onely ſeeke to liue in reputation due vnto their eſtates, and to maintaine the ſame by all lawfull meanes. How falſly alſo this is inſerted by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that <hi>liberty</hi> is ſought, and <hi>not triall of the cauſe,</hi> I commit to the iudgement of all men of any ſence, who vnderſtand how that the prieſts are gone to Rome to his Holines, to haue the caſe decided. <hi>But nor resting here, nor contented with this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome during the dependance of the ſayd Appeales, they haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>to greater diſorders, which is, to publiſh in

               <p>This good fellow preſumeth much of his readers ignorance, fauour or patience. For, as it appeareth by the Archpr. his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>M. Collinton,</hi> he reiected the appeale, &amp; by other his acts he hath declared, that thoſe, who had put their names vnto it, had incurred the penalties of his decrees. He alſo hereupon ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited ſome not to receiue the Sacraments at the appellants hands, as may appeare by his letter of the <hi>16.</hi> of <hi>April 1601.</hi> to a gentleman, where thus he writeth, <hi>This I write to make you priuie of the great ſpirituall danger, wherein you and all that receiue any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of M.</hi> Oſwald Needam <hi>may be, if it be ſo, that he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto a ſeditious pamphlet, coloured with the name of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale.</hi> With what face then doth this fellow, in the Archprieſts behalfe, vrge the <hi>dependance</hi> of the <hi>appeale?</hi> or what <hi>freedome</hi> is that, with which hee would that the appellants ſhould haue bene <hi>contented?</hi> if there was iuſt cauſe to appeale, in what a poore caſe would the Archprieſt bee, if that there were put in execution againſt him, which is due vnto the refuſers of iuſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, and contemners of the ſea Apoſtolike, whither the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale was made? And if the appeale were not a iuſt appeale, how fooliſhly is it here vrged, <hi>that the Priests not resting here, nor contented with this freedome, during the dependance of the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, they haue proceeded to greater diſorders? which is to publiſh in print most iniurious, contumelious, and infamatory bookes, and libels, without particuler name of Author, without licence of ſuperior, &amp;c.</hi> The cauſes of this publiſhing haue bene diuerſly touched by many, who haue proued, that it was moſt neceſſary, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of an vnfeined peace, leſt matters being ſhuffled vp, as once before they were, the Ieſuits ſhould breake out at their pleaſure (as they did once before, not long after the peace was concluded) And being backed with the authoritie of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, bring new quarels euery day worſe, and more grieuous, then the former. And whereas here it is particularly vrged, that <hi>during the dependance of the appeales theſe bookes were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,</hi> it is eaſily anſwered, becauſe the archprieſt ſhewed no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5209:56"/> to his Holines, and to the ſea Apoſtolicke, but denied the dimiſſory letters, which were demanded of him, reiected the appeale, as a <hi>ſeditious pamphlet,</hi> and proceeded againſt the appellants, as if the appeale were no otherwiſe to be eſteemed: as wee haue immediatly before proued, and all Catholicks can teſtifie as much, who haue bene warned not onely from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Sacraments of the appellants, but alſo from being preſent at their ſacrifice, becauſe they ſet their hands to that appeale. And therefore it was iudged neceſſary, that all Catholicks ſhould be informed of the trueth, and how the caſe ſtood in this preſent controuerſie, which, without printing, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently haue bene declared, eſpecially where the matter is ſo hardly followed, that no one of the Prieſts may bee ſuffered to ſpeake for themſelues. And to this effect alſo were the <hi>Latine</hi> bookes printed, that the Prieſts making their cauſe generally knowen in Chriſtendome, they might (maugre their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) come to haue audience, where they deſired, and had once before failed: when, for auoyding of too much ſpeech of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they went in a more priuate ſort for a remedy of home mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Neither ought any man to wonder at this good fellow, when he calleth theſe bookes <hi>Libels:</hi> for the ſpirit moued him in hope at that time, that the Prieſts ſhould be ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from comming to the place, where now they are, and being there ready to proue ſuch things, as are here to be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they doe conuince the vnderſtanding of him, who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and knoweth what belongeth to a libel, that theſe bookes are no <hi>Libels,</hi> againſt which this author inueyeth in theſe hote termes, <hi>iniurious, contumelious, and infamatory bookes or libels.</hi> But by that which followeth, he doeth more diſcouer his folly. He ſaith, that the bookes were publiſhed <hi>in print, without particuler name of Author, without licence of ſuperior, and other circumſtances of modeſtie, right, and conſcience required in ſuch attempts.</hi> Alas good ſir, to omit in this place, what want there is of <hi>other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of modestie,</hi> throughout all the <hi>Apologie,</hi> if it be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>circumstance of modestie, right, and conſcience,</hi> to put to a booke ſome <hi>particuler name of Author,</hi> where was your <hi>modestie, right, and conſcience,</hi> when you publiſhed this <hi>Apologie?</hi> what <hi>particuler name of Author</hi> hath your booke? Haue you not ſet it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5209:57"/> out in theſe general termes <hi>written and ſet forth by Prieſts vnited in due ſubordination to the right reuerend Archprieſt, and other their ſuperiors?</hi> And I pray you (ſir) what <hi>particuler name</hi> is here, and of what author? Good ſir turne once againe the bookes againſt which this <hi>Apologie</hi> is written: and finde this circumſtance of <hi>modeſtie, right, or conſcience</hi> more wanting in their bookes, then in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and then with leſſe ſhame vpbraid the prieſts that they publiſhed <hi>in print without particular name of Author, and other circumſtances of modeſtie, right, and conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to giue a fuller ſatisfaction to our Reader, We affirme that the books which were publiſhed by the Prieſts, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with more <hi>particular name of authour,</hi> then this <hi>Apologie</hi> was, if the <hi>particular name</hi> be that which bringeth the authour to be knowen who he was. For firſt the <hi>Latine</hi> booke, which was publiſhed in print, and dedicated to his Holineſſe, is ſayd to be <hi>exhibited by thoſe Prieſts who were accuſed of Schiſme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crimes.</hi> The Engliſh booke alſo which is intituled, <hi>The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of certaine diſcourſes,</hi> carieth as <hi>particular a name of authour,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>which were extorted from diuers, as their friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them, or their aduerſaries driue them to purge themſelues of the moſt grieuous crimes of ſchiſme, ſedition, rebellion, faction and ſuch like.</hi> Now good ſir, I doe appeale to the indifferent Reader, whether the authors of theſe two books (for this <hi>Apologie</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth none other, as appeareth by the whole diſcourſe thereof, and particularly fol. 8.) were more knowen by this deſcription <hi>accuſed of ſchiſme</hi> (they ſhewing themſelues publiquely in their owne defence) then the authors of the <hi>Apologie</hi> by this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Prieſts vnited in due ſubordination to the Archprieſt,</hi> all the reſt keeping their conſciences to themſelues, that no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is ſure, who can be meant by this name. And ſome of them, who were ſo firmely reputed for ſuch, as the Archprieſt and Ieſuites aduentured to aske their handes or conſents to ſomewhat, which ſome doe thinke ſhould haue bene vſed, for the authorizing or giuing their conſents to the ſetting out of this booke, they tooke this prieſtlike courage vnto them, as to deny to ſet their hands to that, to which they were not to be made priuie. And many more there are (as many doe knowe) who goe for ſuch as are here ſet downe for authours of this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:5209:57"/> who perchance haue their handes as deepe in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, as any of the other. But we will let this ſlip go, hoping that this good fellow will be better aduiſed in his next booke, how he taxeth men for that, in which he doth offend himſelfe, if the fault which hee findeth may be called an offence. But now concerning the other circumſtance, that the bookes were printed <hi>without licence of Superiour.</hi> If this authour will tell vs, whither we ſhould haue gone neere hand to haue found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different <hi>Superior,</hi> we will acknowledge that there was ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Archprieſt was not an indifferent <hi>Superiour</hi> in this caſe, becauſe he was a partie, againſt whom the bookes were to be publiſhed ſo farre foorth as they concerned the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betweene himſelfe and the Prieſts, and therefore he was not likely to giue them licence to print An other <hi>Superior</hi> they know not where to ſeeke in any reaſonable diſtance, to dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their <hi>licence.</hi> Beſides that, to their remembrance, they doe not finde any authority in his Commiſſion, to <hi>licence</hi> bookes to the print being no <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> but a <hi>Subdelegate,</hi> and for certaine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, among which this is not reckoned for any. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance this was the cauſe, why being ſollicited by M. <hi>Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> vpon the comming foorth of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> to certifie him what <hi>Supertours</hi> did <hi>licence</hi> the printing thereof, he knewe not what to anſwere. And if theſe words, <hi>permiſsu ſuperiorum,</hi> bee prooued a neceſſary <hi>circumſtance of modeſtie,</hi> they ſhall be vſed hereafter in our books alſo: Much idle ſtuffe followeth to make an end of this chapter, as that <hi>the Prieſts doe goe about to diſguiſe matters by laying the fault vpon M. Archprieſt and Fa. Parſons, as though they did not deſcend to ſuch particulars, as cannot be applyed vnto any other, but vnto them. They labour to purge themſelues from ſchiſme, in their forbearing to obey the authoritie appointed by his Holineſſe, before they did ſee ſome inſtrument from his Holineſſe, in teſtimony that he had inſtituted, or giuen authoritie to another, for the inſtitution thereof. They complaine of hard dealing vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtudents, and particularly againſt the two Prieſts, who were not ſuffered to come to his Holineſse, being ſent vnto him to deale concerning this new authoritie.</hi> And whereas the Prieſts are here charged to <hi>contemne</hi> the Cardinall <hi>Farneſius</hi> his doing, or writing, or procuring for the Archprieſt a <hi>Protonotariſhip:</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:5209:58"/> This fellow ſeemeth to take it for a diſgrace, not to make ſome ſport among all his big words. For how would a man thinke, that he prooueth this <hi>negligence</hi> or <hi>contempe;</hi> as he tearmeth it? Forſooth the Cardinall procured the Archprieſt to be <hi>proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notarius apoſtolicus.</hi> And what then? doeth it follow, that the prieſts doe <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>contemne,</hi> whatſoeuer the preſent <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Farneſius</hi> hath done or written, or deferred to the Archprieſt, becauſe the Cardinall procured him to be a Notarie? But perchance the booke is falſely printed, and that which followeth, as another <hi>contempt,</hi> is to be vnderſtood to be the onely proofe of the <hi>contempt,</hi> of which here is mention. Theſe are the words, <hi>Neither doe they giue him the title of</hi> Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendiſſimus <hi>due to that degree, and vſed towards him by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall himſelfe in his letters.</hi> We will leaue it to this author to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placate himſelfe, whether this word <hi>neither</hi> implieth a ſecond or one onely <hi>contempt.</hi> We will onely excuſe the Prieſtes for not giuing him the title of <hi>Reuerendiſsimus,</hi> vntill they did know ſome cauſe why. For as it is to be ſuppoſed, the prieſts did not ſee, what Cardinall <hi>Farneſius</hi> writ vnto M. <hi>Blackwell.</hi> Neither yet haue they ſeene any thing, why he may not challenge to be called <hi>Illuſtriſsimus.</hi> And yet, I thinke, it were a wonderfull folly, if they ſhould giue him that title, and he could not but take it as a flout, or a mocke to be ſo called. The reaſon then being all one, the Prieſts knowing no more of the one, then of the other, it is an argument, that this authour wanted both matter, and wit to deuiſe matter. For who would haue vſed ſo great termes againſt prieſts, for not giuing a title to one, to whom a Cardinall gaue it in a priuate letter? In what feare may we be ſtriken, leaſt that ſome Cardinall had alſo written to this authour, and giuen him ſome title, which we know not? Or if any Cardinall would beſtow any honeſt title vpon him, yet this kind of <hi>Reuerendiſsimiſhip,</hi> being a matter of twenty or forty crownes, he might eaſily procure it: and wee might be condemned for <hi>neglecting</hi> or <hi>contemning</hi> ſomewhat, which is not in vſe, where as skilfull <hi>Protonotaries,</hi> as any are in England do keepe open ſhops in euery good towne, and are knowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their honeſt neighbours for ſuch. But we will let this idle exception go, among the other, as idle &amp; railing ſpeeches,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5209:58"/> with which this authour endeth the firſt chapter, and cloſeth vp his readers ſtomacke with them, who cannot but ſee what ſpirit, and in what ſort it mooueth him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor purpoſeth to treate of three things: firſt, <hi>of diſobedience:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>of vndutifull behauiour to ſuperiours</hi> namely <hi>his Holines:</hi> thirdly, <hi>of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and temerarious propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, he bringeth ſome Scriptures, with <hi>if,</hi> and <hi>ands:</hi> as if his reader ſhould prouide himſelfe to heare of a great plumpe: <hi>If all this be ſo as it is</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>alas in what caſe, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo proceedeth to a lamentation ouer his brethren, ſuppoſing that the ſcriptures he brought were as truly applied, as they were true in themſelues. And to prooue the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Prieſts, which the good man ſeemeth to lament, he bringeth a clauſe (as he tearmeth it) of a letter of Card. <hi>Allen</hi> to M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> dated the 16. of <hi>March 1594.</hi> whereby he would haue his reader conceiue very ſtrange matters, and wrongfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelfe of any euill affection or hard opinion of the Cardinall towards the Secular prieſts. And leſt wee ſhould be thought to blame this authors folly without cauſe, wee will ſet downe his owne words as they lie after his <hi>exordium,</hi> together with the Cardinals letter. Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firſt of all to begin with Cardinall</hi> Allen, <hi>of whom theſe men would ſeeme to make most account now he is dead &amp; gone, as though he had fauoured them when he was aliue, which yet (as we ſhall ſhew) is quite contrary: for he in his foreſaid letter of the 16 of</hi> March <hi>to M.</hi> Muſh, <hi>doth moſt earneſtly giue in charge to him and to all other Prieſts, to liue in great vnion with the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Society, <hi>yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his reaſon the ſingular obligation they had to their manifold benefits. His words are theſe: I haue heard</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>to my great
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5209:59"/> griefe, that there is not that good correſpondence betweene the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>and other prieſts. I cannot tell vpon what diſcontentment, &amp;c. But whereof ſoeuer it commeth, it is of the enemie, and with all poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcretion and diligence by the wiſer ſort on both ſides to be rooted out, or els it wil be the ruine of the whole cauſe, &amp;c. Therefore in this point eſpecially</hi> (<hi>M.</hi> Muſh) <hi>be earnest and peremptory with all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and euery one in particular. And tell them, that I charge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them by the bleſſed blood and bowels of Gods mercie, that they honour, loue, and eſteeme one another according to euery mans age, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and profeſsion: and that thoſe of the Secular order, eſpecially thoſe that haue beene brought vp vnder the</hi> Fathers, <hi>and haue found ſo great loue, charity, and helpe in all places at their hands, that they be correſpondent in all gratitude and thankefulneſſe, reuerencing them in word and deed, as is requiſite to their merits and calling, &amp;c. Thus wrote the good Cardinall not aboue halfe a yeere before his death. And by this we ſee, both what his loue &amp; opinion was towards the</hi> Fathers, <hi>and what his commandement and order was to all thoſe priests, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperiour to them all, appointed by his Holineſse, that now are ſo contentious againſt the Ieſuits. What would the good man haue ſaid, if hee had liued till this day, to ſee his requeſt and commandement ſo contemned by them? And how can M.</hi> Muſh <hi>and others name ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Cardinall without bluſhing, when they breake ſo earneſt an exhortation, and order of his in ſo great a matter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contents in this letter are ſo plaine, as I cannot but marueile at this fellow his boldneſſe, and how without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he can make that deſcant which here he doeth.</p>
               <p>The letter (as all men may ſee) was written vpon a ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made vnto the Cardinall, that the Prieſts and Ieſuites were dangerouſly fallen out, as may appeare by thoſe words, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell vpon what diſcontentment.</hi> And afterward, <hi>Therefore in this point eſpecially</hi> (M. Muſh) <hi>be earneſt and peremptory with all parties, and euery one in particular.</hi> Thirdly the charge and aduiſe which was giuen, was as deepely giuen to the Ieſuits as to the Prieſts, as may appeare by the wordes immediatly following thoſe which we laſt cited: <hi>And tell them that I charge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them, by the bleſſed blood and bowels of Gods mercie, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, loue, and eſteeme one another, according to euery mans age, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and profeſsion.</hi> Fourthly, the particular exhortation to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5209:59"/> Secular prieſts to be <hi>correſpondent in all gratitude and thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse to the Ieſuits loue, charitie, and helpe, with reuerence in word and deed,</hi> not only as was <hi>requiſite,</hi> but as was aboue their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and calling,</hi> was long ſince preuented, as appeareth by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of F. <hi>Campion</hi> to F. <hi>Euerard the generall of the ſocietie</hi> (with whome there was no cauſe why hee ſhould diſſemble) as may be ſeene in the <hi>Epiſtle of pious griefe,</hi> fol. 6. &amp; 7. Theſe are his words there cited: <hi>Tanta eſt aeſtimatio, quam de nobis concitarunt Presbyteri, ipſietiam piiſsimi, &amp; doctiſsimi, vt niſi timidè comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum ſentiam: The Prieſts here, who are moſt learned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haue raiſed ſuch an opinion of vs, as I cannot ſpeake it without feare:</hi> which ſaying of F. <hi>Campion</hi> proouing nothing but a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in all gratitude</hi> on the behalfe of the prieſts for the <hi>loue, charitie, and helpe,</hi> which they had or might haue of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I cannot but wonder at the <hi>Epiſtle maker,</hi> who bringeth it to prooue a <hi>correſpondence</hi> in the behalfe of the Ieſuits, vnleſſe perchance he meane, that no other <hi>gratitude</hi> is to be expected of a Ieſuite, then that he will tell his generall, what benefits he receiueth. This <hi>correſpondence</hi> of the Prieſts was ſo followed ſtill by them, vntill the Ieſuits grewe ſo inſolent, as thoſe, who brought them into credit, were forced to ſtand at their reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and without reſpect either to <hi>age, order, or profeſsion,</hi> they went about tyrannically to haue the gouernment ouer the Prieſts, as may be prooued as well by their attempt at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> as by the beginnings abroad, where Catholikes had no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for Prieſts of what <hi>age, order, or profeſsion ſoeuer,</hi> vnleſſe they did come by order of a Ieſuite, and ſo would the Cardinal haue ſaid, <hi>if he might haue liued till this day:</hi> notwithſtanding his requeſt and commaundement giuen as well vnto the Secular Prieſts as Ieſuits, in theſe words: <hi>Tell them, that I charge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them by the bleſſed blood and bowels of Gods mercy, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, loue, and esteeme one another according to euery mans age, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and profeſsion:</hi> yet this fellow, without bluſhing, citeth this letter to prooue the Cardinals more ſpeciall affection before his death to the Ieſuits, then vnto the Prieſts, wherin he giueth a like round charge to them both: and in that hee gaue this commiſſion to a Secular prieſt, <hi>to be peremptory with all parties,</hi> this letter doeth rather prooue, that hee fauoured the Secular
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5209:60"/> prieſts then the Ieſuits. And thus much concerning thoſe fond collections which are made out of this letter by the author of this <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our author hauing ſhewed (as he ſuppoſeth) that the prieſts haue diſobeyed this the Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> his commandement, (whereas indeed the Ieſuits did breake it, and draue the prieſts to ſtand vpon their owne neceſſarie defence) he pretendeth to ſhew the prieſts their <hi>progreſſe from worſe to worſe:</hi> but in verie deed diſcouereth his owne in the ſame kind. And firſt he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runneth his reader, by briefly touching (but vntruly, as will be ſhewed in the particular treatiſe of the Romane ſtirs) the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of the ſtudents in Rome with the Ieſuites: and as if his words were <hi>Oracles,</hi> hee applyeth ſome places of Scripture (as he knoweth who did to our Sauiour in the deſert) then hee purſueth his former confuted falſhood, of the beginning of <hi>new aſſociations</hi> in England, after the aforeſaid tumults ended in Rome, &amp; telleth his reader that his Holines perceiuing the ſame <hi>to tend to a new diuiſion and contention, as well by the lawes and rules thereof, as by a certaine new, contumelious, and moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Memoriall, <hi>ſent ouer againſt the Ieſuits, hee appointed them</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>a ſuperiour of their owne order, as you haue heard, and ſuch an one, as their owne two ambaſsadours ſent to Rome, confeſsed vnder their owne hands and othes (as appeareth in their examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that he had bene the likelieſt man of al others to be choſen by voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if the election had beene permitted vnto them.</hi> And ſo he goeth on without any newe matter, or any thing that needeth newe anſwer: only this we are to note (for ſo much as we can learne) that neither of thoſe two Prieſts (whom here he calleth <hi>the two ambaſſadours</hi>) did euer ſay or <hi>ſweare</hi> ſo much, as here they are charged: neither can it be <hi>prooued out of their examinations,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Ieſuits haue ſhewed their skill in corrupting, or falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe examinations, as they haue done in other writings. The challenge alſo which followeth, that <hi>the Prieſts did not obey the Archprieſt at the ſight of the Cardinall</hi> Caietans <hi>letters,</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but now lately by M. <hi>Collington</hi> ſufficiently anſwered. And if the Cardinall had vpon his owne proper motion, expected an abſolute <hi>blind obedience</hi> vnto him, it had argued too great a want of conſideration in him.</p>

               <p>There is alſo a full ſatisfaction giuen, that what the prieſtes did, might very wel ſtand with <hi>obedience,</hi> and with <hi>humility,</hi> and was not againſt any <hi>oath</hi> which any tooke, when they were ſchollers of the Seminaries: that <hi>oath</hi> being no other, then to take orders, when the ſuperiour would haue them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into England, when they ſhould be ſent, <hi>ad lucrandas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimas: to gaine ſoules to God:</hi> which they did performe vntill this new authority, pretending power to take away their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (by which they laboured in their vocation) <hi>ſolo nutu</hi> (to vſe M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> words to M <hi>Charnock,</hi> in his letters 17. <hi>Iunij 1600.</hi>) <hi>at his becke</hi> did make them ceaſe (for ſcandall ſake) to doe that, to which by oath they were bound.

For as I take it, this fellow will not ſtand obſtinately in this hereſie, <hi>that a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior cannot doe any thing, or command any thing amiſſe, wherein a ſubiect may refuſe to obey him,</hi> although he were ſworne to obey him, as now many are. For ſuch oathes are alwayes to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to be obſerued in iuſt and lawfull matters, or at the moſt in ſuch, as are not to bee prooued moſt vniuſt, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as theſe are, which the Archprieſt doth command, to wit: that they ſhal not defend themſelues, nor be defended of other from the infamie of <hi>ſchiſme, ſedition, faction, rebellion</hi> and ſuch like, whereof they know themſelues to be moſt cleere, and that the ſuffering of ſuch ſlanders to goe vncontrolled, would bee moſt iniurious to themſelues, preiudiciall to Gods Church, in which they liue as paſtors, and diſhonorable to God himſelfe, to whoſe ſeruice they haue, with their vttermoſt peril, deuoted themſelues. But to make all apparant in one word: the prieſts obeyed ſo ſoone as they knew it to be his Holineſſe will, that it ſhould be ſo, as appeareth by the ſecond <hi>Breue, dated 17 Auguſt 1601</hi> if there were no other profe for it.

And whereas this author doeth firſt begin to except againſt ſome ſpeeches, vttered by letters, conteined in the Engliſh booke, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptuouſly ſpoken of the dignity, and office of the Archprieſt, and alſo of the maner of the inſtitution thereof by his Hol. the reader is to vnderſtand, that in this there is very euil dealing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that thoſe ſpeeches, which were vſed, were vſed before it was knowen, that his Holines had his finger in it. And they were the more boldly vſed, becauſe it was preſumed, that the authority was not inſtituted by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, but by the Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> who in his letter conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue affirmeth, that <hi>this was his owne ordinance:</hi> although hee ſaith in one place in generall termes, that he <hi>was commanded to make a peace in England</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the falſe ſuggeſtion, that the prieſts and Catholiks were at warres. And in another place that <hi>hee followed the Popes will,</hi> who thought it meet that there ſhould be <hi>a ſubordination</hi> in England, being induced thereunto by reaſon giuen him by prieſts: whereas to this day neither were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons euer heard, nor what prieſts they were who gaue them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perchance a few Ieſuits, who are exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Nothing then being knowen to the contrary, but that it was a deuiſe of the Ieſuits, and an inſtitution of the Card. <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> by their meanes, without any letters to one effect, or other from his Holines, as is here confeſſed in this <hi>Apol. Cap. 1 fol. 7.</hi> the prieſts might the more iuſtly terme the authority by ſuch names, as to them it ſeemed then to deſerue, to wit <hi>a new, and extraordinary authority vnpleaſing, obtruded, diſorderly procured gouernment, exorbitant and altogether diſſonant from reaſon, &amp; the accuſtomed practiſe of Gods Church, and that it was already thought by the Councell, to bee of purpoſe erected, not for Religion, but for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:5209:62"/> better effecting of plots and deſignments of State.</hi> For although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the title of an Archprieſt be <hi>new,</hi> nor the authoritie of an Archpt <hi>extraordinary,</hi> yet may this authoritie be termed both <hi>new</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> being ſuch as was neuer heard of, to haue bene before giuen to ſo meane a Prelate. It was called an <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing authority,</hi> for that it was meerely affectiue, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the conſtitutiue letters: and if it haue now any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do any good to any, the Prelate is to giue thankes for ſuch thankes for ſuch his authority to thoſe prieſts, who found the fault. It was ſaid to be <hi>obtruded,</hi> for that neither the prieſts knew, that it came by any lawfull authority, nor it ſelfe brought any gratefull thing with it, but rather did grace and ſtrengthen the faction of the Ieſuits againſt them, the Archpr. being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his inſtructions to doe nothing of moment, without the aduiſe of the Ieſuits, who had already begun a moſt ſcandalous ſedition in England. It was ſaid to be <hi>diſorderly procured &amp;c.</hi> both in reſpect of the falſe ſuggeſtion, which was the mother thereof, (as may appeare by the conſtitutiue letter) and alſo in reſpect that the principall actors in the procuring thereof were men of an other order, who were not onely free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it, but muſt be directors alſo in it, eſpecially in matters of moment, as appeareth by the Archpr. his 6 inſtruction. All which maner of proceeding being right well knowen, and that theſe principall procurers, and counſellers were ſuch, as were alſo knowen to the Counſell to be more medling in matters of State, then became them, they could not ſhoot very wide, who affirmed that this authority was already thought by her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Councell to be of purpoſe erected, for the better effecting of ſuch deſignments. Neither was this to bring the archpr. or any good Cath that ſhould obey him, within the compaſſe of treaſon, for matter of State: but a reaſon which al good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes might take, why the prieſts were not euer forward, to run after the noueltie, hauing no other warrant for it, then a letter of a Cardinall, who vnder colour of pietie might eaſily be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Ieſuits knowen Stateſmen) to do any thing, which might further their deſignments. And the Counſel being kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be thus poſſeſſed, the prieſts had no reaſon to runne fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into diſpleaſure of her Maieſtie, &amp; her Hon. Councell: but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5209:62"/> rather ſeeke to be well aſſured, that the ground thereof was no State plot, but Religion, for which they haue bene, and are moſt ready to ſhed their blood, when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſuffer it. But where doeth this good fellow ſhew, that the prieſts would <hi>bring all good Catholikes, that ſhould obey the ordination, &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, within the compaſse of treaſon for matter of State?</hi> See I pray you how he choppeth Logike: <hi>which point theſe men, to worke more miſchiefe, do teach the perſecutors in plaine words: againe a litle after in the ſame page in theſe words.</hi> Beſides <hi>all this by the opinions of diuers men in the Lawes of our Countrey this our cauſe may, and wilbe drawen within the compaſſe of an olde Lawe enacted as well by our Catholike Biſhops and Prelats, as by the Prince aboue 300. yeeres agoe, viz. the Law of</hi> Premunire, <hi>becauſe it is an externall iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought into this Realme, againſt the wil, &amp; notice of the prince and countrey: which made the late reuerend Biſhop of</hi> Lincolne, <hi>D.</hi> Watſon, <hi>to refuſe all externall iuriſdiction offered him ouer his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, although once hee had lawfull Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction within the Realme, &amp; was vnlawfully depriued thereof.</hi> Thus much doeth this author cite out of the Engliſh booke, to proue that the prieſts, <hi>to worke miſchiefe doe teach the perſecutors in plaine words,</hi> that all who obey the archprieſt, are within compaſſe of treaſon. Is this fellow in his right wits trow ye? or muſt not his Reader be very credulous, or at the leaſt very forgetfull, who being told, that he ſhall ſee how the Prieſts <hi>to worke miſchiefe teach the perſecutours</hi> a leſſon to bring the obedient within compaſſe of <hi>treaſon,</hi> muſt be ſerued with an example of <hi>a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire?</hi> But neither doe the Prieſts affirme in this place, that the Archprieſt, or thoſe who obey him, incurre the Statute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> but ſay onely, that <hi>by the opinions of diuers men in the Lawes of our Countrey, this our cauſe may, and will be drawen within the compaſse of an olde Law, &amp;c.</hi> And in that they ſay <hi>of diuers men,</hi> they leaue a ſcope for others to be of the contrary opinion. And if the matter were ſo cleare, as all men were of that opinion, there being as expert Lawyers of the Priuie Councell, as any other are, how can they bee thought to bee taught by the Prieſts, that there is here in our caſe any danger of a <hi>Premunire?</hi> Who can iudge whether the follie
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5209:63"/> of this authour or his malice were greater, when he alleaged this ſentence out of the Prieſts their booke, to prooue that they <hi>to worke more miſchiefe, did hereby teach the perſecutours in plaine wordes to bring all good Catholikes that obey this ordination and the Archprieſt appointed by his Holines, within the compaſſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for matter of State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs put the caſe that there were no danger of a <hi>Premuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> in this our caſe: yet if by the opinions of diuers men in the lawes of our Countrey, it might, or would be drawen within the compaſſe of ſuch a law, it had bene wiſedome to haue pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon the matter, and not to haue runne ouer headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great a danger vpon a letter of a Cardinall: which added affliction vnto affliction, without any good, or eaſe to men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe afflicted, and might very well haue bene omitted, and God much better ſerued, except onely in the triall of his prieſts, who haue euer ſince the inſtitution of this authoritie, liued vnder a grieuous yoke, and moſt extreame perſecution, vnder the Archprieſt, Ieſuites, and other their ouer forward, and buſie adherents.</p>
               <p>And whereas this authour noteth, that the Prieſts would haue conſent of the prince (though different from them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) to be needfull for legitimation of this authoritie, hee doth but ſhew how his pen can play the Gentleman vſher to his wit. The leſſe the likelihood is, that the Prince would le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate this authoritie, the greater was the reaſon, which the Prieſts did vſe for their forbearance to yeelde vnto it. It is very well knowen, that when the prince did not differ in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the ſtatutes againſt the prouiſion of dignities from Rome was ſued. And can any man of reaſon hope for more fauour at the hands of a prince, who doth differ in religion? If this Archipresbyterie could be prooued ſo neceſſary, as without it the Catholike religion could not ſtand in England, this glanſe were to ſome purpoſe, and the Prieſts no doubt, would haue bene as reſolute in the behalfe of the Catholike faith, as they are not ſparing their liues in the defence thereof, which they daily giue for it, although through the buſineſſe of a fewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Stateſmen, they are all generally taken for ſuch, and are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5209:63"/> put to death as traytors. But the Archipresbyterie being no way ſo neceſſary, but that it might with much more profit to Gods Church haue bene wanting, the Prieſts moſt reſolute to die in defence of the Catholike faith, might aduiſe themſelues whether it were wiſedome, to runne needeleſly into an other danger, and of ſuch qualitie, as if the magiſtrate had no way differed in Religion, he would haue put the law in execution againſt them.</p>
               <p>An other note, which this authour maketh, is, that <hi>by the Countrey,</hi> the Prieſts muſt needes meane themſelues only: that is to ſay, <hi>ſome fiue or ſixe that oppoſed themſelues at the beginning, for that his Holineſse had not asked their conſents.</hi> See I pray you, how this fellow ſtil thruſteth in <hi>his Holineſſe</hi> in this action, who was not knowen in 12. moneths after, to haue dealt therein, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what might be gathered by the impriſonment of the two Prieſts, who went out of England to Rome, to haue ſhewed what they, and others thought meete hee ſhould vnderſtand; although this their impriſonment being ſuch, and in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, before they had audience, was an argument to ſome, that it was not his action, and that aſwell <hi>his Holineſſe</hi> in particular, as that Sea, and thoſe who did fly thither for ſuccour, were too too much abuſed: and this impriſonment of the two prieſts was about ten moneths after the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Archipresbyterie. How handſomely would this fellowes muſicke ſound, were this ſtring in tune, vpon which he harpeth ſo often? But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo generally knowen, that his Holines was not ſeene in the action vntill his <hi>Breue</hi> came, which was aboue a yeere after the inſtitution of the authoritie, no man but he, who is paſt ſhame, would ſo often vrge <hi>his Holineſſe,</hi> or <hi>diſobedience to his Holineſſe.</hi> And in this place he giueth this cauſe in mockage, why <hi>fiue or ſixe oppoſed themſelues at the beginning, for that his Holineſſe had not asked their conſents.</hi> Alas poore man, how faine he is of any fooliſh conceite, to bring the prieſts into a contempt with the Catholikes? Whoſe <hi>conſent did his Holineſſe aske,</hi> when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the authoritie by his <hi>Breue?</hi> I am well aſſured that he asked not the conſent of any of them: and yet if the Pope be of any credit, or his <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt 1601.</hi> they did
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5209:64"/> all preſently without delay yeeld themſelues. So that this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd fiction of this fellow is too too apparant. I would alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether his Holineſſe had the conſent of any of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſts in England, when this authoritie was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of how many? If he had not the conſent of them, as doubtleſſe he had not, more then what M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> a Ieſuit by promiſe (abuſing the prieſts) gaue for them, &amp; in their names, who ſent him not: why is this vrged againſt <hi>fiue or ſixe,</hi> as though all the reſt had giuen their conſents to the inſtitution thereof? If he had the conſent of the prieſtes, why was there ſuch canuaſing for voyces, or hands to be ſet to a letter which began thus: <hi>Olim dicebamur?</hi> Why were ſo many threatned? Why were others (who were not to be threatned) ſollicited, with, Now <hi>it is Fa. Parſons deuiſe, you muſt not deny your hand?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to an other: <hi>you ſhall not deny me, to ſet your hand vnto it:</hi> And afterward his hand was ſet to it, and he knew not thereof, nor gaue any conſent thereto. And in this kind did the Ieſuits labour, and poſted from one to another, to get conſents, after that they ſawe ſome to forbeare to yeelde themſelues vnto it. What deuiſes were vſed to others for their liking hereof, may alſo be gathered by M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> behauiour in this point: who ſending for M. <hi>Collington,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> vrged them to like thereof, and threatned them, that vnleſſe they would poſitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that they did like thereof, he was to ſend informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Rome, that they did diſlike thereof: notwithſtanding they would giue no other anſwere, then this vnto him: that they did neither like, nor would diſlike, but would beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as became Catholike prieſts to do. And this was all the <hi>oppoſition</hi> which was made <hi>at the beginning,</hi> and it was by fewer then <hi>6. or 5.</hi> for it was by theſe two only, which were enow, and are as many, and perchance one more then at the <hi>beginning</hi> vſe to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt ſpringing <hi>hereſies, errors, falſhoods,</hi> or the <hi>miſdemeanors</hi> of ſuch, as aduenture to ſhew themſelues in priuate, before they appeare more openly to the world. The cauſes of this <hi>oppoſition</hi> (as this fellow tearmeth it) are diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon at large by M. <hi>Iohn Collington,</hi> in his booke lately ſet foorth of this argument. And thus much in anſwere of that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5209:64"/> which this author noteth vpon the prieſts wordes, which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this place.</p>
               <p>After theſe notes taken vpon the prieſts words, he declareth his opinion of the ſtatute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> in this maner. <hi>And as for the Statute of</hi> Premunire <hi>by them mentioned, it is not ſo ancient as they make it, but was begunne to be treated, about the time that</hi> Wickliffe <hi>roſe vp, when</hi> emulation <hi>was in heate againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: and the chiefe purpoſe thereof was, at the beginning to prohibite appellation to Rome in the firſt inſtance, vnder the paines aforeſaid: and the worst kings of England euer ſince haue most vrged it, and it was not made (as theſe men ſay) by our Catholike Biſhops, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, nor could in conſcience, but ſorely rather againſt their wils was it paſſed in Parliament by the ſtreame of Temporall power, and</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>againſt them, &amp;c.</hi> If the prieſts did ſpeake of a Statute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> according to the opinions of men well ſeene in the lawes of our Realme, how impertinent is this to tell vs, what the chiefe purpoſe thereof was at the beginning? and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that <hi>the chiefe purpoſe thereof was to prohibite appellation to Rome in the firſt inſtance,</hi> and therefore <hi>no Catholike Biſhop, or Prelate could in conſcience agree to the making thereof:</hi> doeth not this fellow ſhew himſelfe to be paſt ſhame, in bringing in this conceite, to the infinite diſcredit of the Archprieſt and his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? We will here omit, how the Archprieſt (who according to his ſixth inſtruction, is <hi>to doe nothing of moment without the aduiſe of the Ieſuites</hi>) when he ſent firſt to ſpeake with M. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> ſtood very ſtiffely vnto it, <note place="margin">In his letters to M. Collington.</note> 
                  <hi>that we might not appeale from him to Rome,</hi> vntill it was often inculcated vnto him, how dangerous that propoſition was. We wil alſo here omit his commandements vnto vs, not to goe to Rome, firſt to pleade our cauſe in hand: for to this perchance anſwere may be made, that he had procured, that it ſhould be firſt heard in Flanders, before his Holineſſe his <hi>Nuncio:</hi> to whom when our brethren preſented themſelues, and ſhewed themſelues readie to haue their cauſe heard, no one appeared for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, although he had before giuen out by his letters, what potent aduerſaries the prieſts ſhould there find in this behalfe: <note place="margin">The Nuntio his letter to M.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5209:65"/> conſcience haue his godly tutors aduiſed him, and he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to puniſh ſuch as haue appealed to Rome, becauſe they haue appealed to Rome, as his owne hand will iuſtifie it againſt him: namely in his <hi>letter to a lay gentleman</hi> dated the 16. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 1601.</hi> where he affirmeth, that he writeth vnto him, <hi>to make him priuie of the great ſpirituall danger, wherein he, and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any ſacrament of M.</hi> Oſwald Needam <hi>might be, if it were ſo, that the ſaid M.</hi> Needam <hi>had ſubſcribed vnto a ſeditious pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet</hi> (theſe are his words) <hi>coloured with the name of an Appeale?</hi> And hauing denounced M. <hi>Robert Drewrie</hi> to haue incurred the penalties of his Decrees, for ſubſcribing to the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, he ſent vnto him a forme of ſubmiſſion, which he was to make, or not be reſtored. And this was the forme of that ſubmiſſion. <hi>Ego N. confiteor, &amp;c. I doe confeſſe and acknowledge, that without any iuſt cauſe I haue complayned of grieuances, and many iniuries offered mee by the moſt Reuerend archprieſt, and haue caſt vpon him the blame of theſe diſſentions, tumuls, and deadly warres, and that I haue tranſgreſsed his wholeſome Decrees, of all which I humbly craue pardon, reſtitution of my faculties, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing of Cenſures, if I haue incurred them. And I recall all theſe aforeſaid, and doe greatly wiſh, that I had neuer ſpoken, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or approoued them. Moreouer, I doe ſweare that I will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after behaue my ſelfe peaceably, and obediently towards this my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and will procure according to my bounden duetie what lieth in me, that others doe the ſame.

               <p>The decree which the archprieſt made, and by the ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the appeale was, and is iudged by him to be broken, and theſe grieuous penalties thereby incurred by thoſe, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, beareth date <hi>18. Octob. 1600.</hi> The words of the decree are theſe <hi>Prohibemus autem ſub poena ſuſpenſionis à diuinis, &amp; amiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis omnium facultatum, ne quis ſacerdos vllo modo ſuffragia vel ſcripto, vel verbo danda ambiat, vel det, ad quamcum<expan>

Wee forbid vnder paine of ſuſpenſion from diuine offices, &amp; of loſse of all faculties, euery Prieſt to go about, to take any ſuffrage, or voyce, any maner of way, either by writing, or by word of mouth, or to giue any ſuch ſuffrage, or voyce to any matter whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5209:65"/> which is not knowen to haue bene before communicated to vs, or vnto two of our</hi> Aſſiſtants. This is the decree, &amp; by vertue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Appellants ſo ſetting their hands, or giuing conſent, that their hands ſhould be ſet to the Appeale, are ſaid to haue loſt their faculties, and incurred the conſures, which, were the Law a iuſt Law, is not true, the penaltie not being inflicted therein, but onely threatned. And whereas the Archprieſt, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, to faue him from thoſe penalties, which are due, and are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> incurred by thoſe who forbid Appeales to Rome, affirme, that there was <hi>a Libel</hi> and an <hi>Appeale,</hi> &amp; that his decree was broken, and the penalties therein conteined, were incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſubſcribing to the <hi>Libel,</hi> and not to the <hi>Appeale;</hi> it is a poore ſhift, and to be vſed but in a few corners: for in his letter before cyted, he maketh no difference, but in the name onely: For theſe are his words, concerning <hi>M Needam, If it be ſo that he hath ſubſcribed vnto a ſeditious pamphlet, coloured with the name of an Appeale.</hi> So that now it is too late, to make two things of that, to which the prieſts did ſubſcribe. Secondly it is a very groſſe ignorance, to make two matters of that <hi>Appeale,</hi> all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters affirming that Appeales made <hi>à grauaminibus, from grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances,</hi> muſt expreſly conteine them. For breuitie ſake <hi>Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot L. 3. Inſtit. Iuris Can. tit. de Apella.</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Multum autem intereſt, ab interlocutoria, vel alio grauamine, an à definitiua: nam primo caſu, &amp; cauſam &amp;c. There is a great difference betweene appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from an interlocutory ſentence, or other grieuance, and a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſentence. For in the firſt caſe the cauſe of the Appeale muſt be put downe in writing, &amp;c.</hi> Yea it is ſo eſſentiall a point to ſuch an Appeale, as no caſe can be pleaded, which is not expreſſed in the Appeale, as is ſhewed in that <hi>Clementine, Appellanti de Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationibus.</hi> Thus ſaith the Pope, <hi>Appellanti ab interlocutoria, vel à grauamine iudicis, non licet alias cauſas proſequi, quam in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatione ſua nominatim duntaxat expreſſas &amp;c. It is not lawfull for the Appellant from an interlocutory ſentence, or from a grieuance of a Iudge, to proſecute any cauſes, but ſuch onely, as are by name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his Appeale &amp;c.</hi> If then there be nothing in that, which he calleth <hi>a ſeditious pamphlet,</hi> or a <hi>Libel,</hi> but an <hi>Appeale,</hi> contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as it ought) the cauſes thereof, what a poore ſhift is this, to ſay that the Archprieſt puniſheth, or denounceth none to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5209:66"/> haue incurred his penalties conteined in his Edicts for ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the <hi>Appeale,</hi> but onely for their ſubſcribing to <hi>a ſeditious pamphlet, or a libell, colored with the name of an Appeale,</hi> or prefixed to an <hi>Appeale?</hi> The whole Appeale is now ſet forth in Engliſh by M <hi>Colington</hi> in his late booke, that euery man may ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any other thing, then we haue ſaid: that is, an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,</hi> with the cauſes thereof expreſſed, as it ought to be, and as we haue ſufficiently proued, it being ſo euident a trueth, as no man may without bluſhing deny it. And to conclude this point; if we ſhould attribute ſo much ignorance to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, and his buſie adherents, as that they would ſeparate the <hi>Appeale</hi> from the cauſes thereof, being an Appeale <hi>a grauamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, from grieuances</hi> (as it lieth open to all mens view to be ſuch) then there is a much greater deformitie in his actions, who proclaimeth, that the Prieſts haue ſubſcribed to <hi>a ſeditious pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, or a Libel</hi> annexed or prefixed to an <hi>Appeale:</hi> and that they haue thereby incurred the cenſures, and other penalties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in his Edict of the 18. <hi>of Octob. 1600.</hi> becauſe there is not one name ſubſcribed to any thing, but to that, which he muſt confeſſe is really the <hi>Appeale,</hi> if hee make ſuch a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Appeale,</hi> and that, which he ſaith is prefixed vnto it. And conſequently, he muſt confeſſe that he hath incurred the cenſures of holy Church, and the iudgement giuen againſt the Biſhops in this place of the <hi>Apologie.</hi> Thoſe Kings of England, who had the will to prohibite by Statute <hi>Appeales</hi> to Rome, doubtleſſe had neuer the grace to goe to <hi>Gooſe faire,</hi> where not onely they, but their Nobles alſo, aſwell the Spirituall, as the Temporall might haue learned, how they might with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue enacted, or conſented to the making of ſuch a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. But this one thing was wanting to make perfect their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie in this world: they neuer eate a gooſe at that faire, where the courteſie is to miniſter geeſe to all commers <hi>gratis,</hi> and the Hoſt will not receiue any money for them: onely they muſt pay for the ſawce, which (according to the cuſtome of the faire) they muſt haue, or els they muſt haue no gooſe. O happy day, wherein that faire was firſt inſtituted, and a ſecret diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; which no Catholike Kings or Prelats could euer attaine vnto. And thrice happy are they, who by the light (as it ſhould
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:5209:66"/> ſee me) of that day did ſee to make that <hi>Statute</hi> in the third yere of the Archipreſ byterie of M. <hi>George Blackwell, vidi preuarican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp;c. 18. Octob. 1600,</hi> wherein, al right to appeale to Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt Catholikely conſerued, the penalties therein contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doe onely light vpon ſuch as haue ſet their hands to that, which is prefixed to the Appeale, which is nothing els, but the cauſes thereof: without which (according to the cuſtome, and Canons of holy Church) the appeale is of no force, and are therefore by name to be expreſſed, as we haue before ſhewed out of the <hi>Clementine: Appellantide Appellationibus.</hi> Now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that we ſhew when, and vpon what occaſions the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were made, by which the prouiſions from Rome, and ſome Appeales to Rome were forbidden.</p>
               <p>Firſt concerning theſe prouiſions, there was a ſtatute made, either in the 30. or 35. or as ſome other affirme 25. <hi>Edward 1.</hi> which was aboue 300. yeeres ſince, wherein it is agreed, and eſtabliſhed, that they ſhould not be ſuffered. There was alſo the like ſtatute made in the 25. yere of <hi>Edw. 3</hi> to the like effect, by which it was forbidden, that any ſhould be placed in any dignitie, without the aſſent of the King. The ſame is alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Parliament holden in the 38. of the ſame King. The occaſions of enacting theſe ſtatutes are ſet downe, as well in that of the 25. of <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> as elſewhere: &amp; the iuſtice of thoſe, which were made in the time of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> is the more apparant by a letter, which hee and his nobles ſent in the 17. yeere of his reigne, to his Hol. to haue redreſſe for ſuch defaults, as were in that kind committed. The Letter was to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King</hi> Edward <hi>and his Nobles perceiuing the derogation that was done to the Realme, by ſuch reſeruations, prouiſions, and collations of benefices, as the Pope practiſed here in England, wrote to him, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that ſith the Churches of England had beene founded and endowed by noble and worthy men, to the end the people might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by people of their owne language: and that he, being ſo farre off, could not vnderſtand the defaults: yet his predeceſſors, and hee more then had been vſed, by diuers reſeruations, prouiſions, and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to diuers perſons, ſome ſtrangers, yea and ſome enemies to the Realme, whereby the money and profits were carried forth, their Cures not prouided for according to the founders minds: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5209:67"/> vpon due conſiderations thereof, ſignified vnto him, that they could not ſuffer ſuch enormities any longer: and therefore beſought him, to reuoke ſuch reſeruations, prouiſions, and collations, wholly to auoid ſuch ſlanders, miſchiefes, and harmes as might enſue; and that the Cures might be committed to perſons meete for the exerciſes of the ſame, beſeeching him further without delay, to ſignifie his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſith they meant to beſtow their diligence to remedie the matter, and ſee that redreſſe might be had. Giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in full Parliament at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter <hi>18. of</hi> May <hi>Anno Dom. 1343.</hi> Thus far out of <hi>Iohn Stow 17. Edw. 3.</hi> where he alſo citeth <hi>Auesburie</hi> and <hi>Honingford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the forbidding of the appeales to Rome, we find a Statute made in the 27. of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> againſt thoſe who ſhall drawe any perſon in plea (out of the Realme) of a thing <hi>whereof the knowledge appertained to the Kings Court,</hi> or of ſuch things <hi>whereof iudgement was giuen in the Kings courts,</hi> or ſhould ſue in any other courts <hi>to defeate or let the iudgements giuen in the Kings Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe, and other Statutes to the like effect, the author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> affirmeth, that the Catholike Biſhops neither did nor could aſſent. But whatſoeuer may be ſaid for or againſt this poſition, concerning the appeales, no man can in reaſon think, but that they both might very well, and did aſſent to thoſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which were made againſt the prouiſions, or beſtowing of dignities in England, without the kings conſent, the cauſes are ſo apparantly layd downe by the King and the Nobles, for that abridging of his Holines his promoting whom he would, and to what dignities hee would in England. And thus much may be alledged in the behalfe of the conſent of the ſpirituall Lords to the ſtatute againſt thoſe appeales, That in the new great abridgement printed <hi>Anno 1551.</hi> there is this clauſe ſet to the end of ſome ſtatutes, <hi>But the ſpirituall Lords aſſented not to this ſtatute.</hi> And there is no ſuch note ſet to any of theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which we haue here cited.</p>
               <p>It is alſo euident, that theſe ſtatutes were not made vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heate of <hi>emulation</hi> againſt the Clergie: for as we finde that in the 38. yeere of King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> the ſtatutes againſt thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions made in the 25. and 27. of the ſame King, are confirmed, although there be ſome fauour giuen to the Lords and Prelats
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5209:67"/> offendors: ſo in the 39 yeere of the ſame King (which was the next yeere after) we find that the Clergie in England was in as great honour, as any Clergie in the worlde, as may be ſhewed by the offices which the Biſhops and Prieſts had then in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was Lord Chancellour of England: the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> was L. Treaſurer: the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of <hi>Lincolne</hi> was Lord priuie Seale: the Parſon of <hi>Somerſam</hi> was maſter of the Rolles: ten beneficed Prieſts were maſters of the Chancerie: the Deane of S. <hi>Martins le grand</hi> was chiefe Chancellour of the Exchequer, Receiuer, and Keeper of the Kings Treaſure and Iewels: the Archd. of <hi>Northampton</hi> was Chancellor of the Exchequer: a Prebendarie of S. <hi>Martins</hi> was Clerk of the priuie Seale: a Prebendarie of S. <hi>Steuens</hi> was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Kings houſe: the Parſon of <hi>Auon</hi> or <hi>Oundell</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Wardrobe: the Parſon of <hi>Fenny Stanton</hi> was one of the Chamberlaines of the Excheq. and Keeper of the Kings Treaſury and Iewels. Other of the Clergie are noted to haue ben in office alſo in France, &amp; in Ireland, as well as in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> Duke of Lancaſter, the fourth ſonne of King <hi>Edward 3.</hi> hauing the gouernement of England committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the time of his fathers laſt ſickeneſſe (which was in the 50. and 51. of his reigne) diſpoſed ſo farre of matters and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as he conceiued ſome poſſibility to attaine to the Crown, and to depriue his nephew, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who was ſonne to the Blacke prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third. But perceiuing that it would be hard for him, to obtaine his purpoſe, ſo long as the Church ſtood in that eſtate it did, and the citizeens of London enioyed their liberties, hee laboured to ouerthrow them both. For the ruine of the Citie liberties, he deuiſed that it ſhould no more be gouerned by the <hi>Maior,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> but by ſome Captaine, appointed for the purpoſe: And that the <hi>Marſhall</hi> of England (who then was a truſtie friend of his, and placed in that office by him) ſhould vſe his authoritie, as well in London, and the liberties thereof, as els where: which the Commons taking in euill part, roſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in great multitudes, and in <hi>heate of emulation</hi> (to vſe this authors words) ſought the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhall</hi> with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if the Biſhop of London had not happened to appeaſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5209:68"/> them, the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Marſhall</hi> had not eſcaped them. But when all was quiet, and the beſt of the Citie (for the common ſort would not obey it) had giuen ſuch ſatisfaction, as the king commanded, the <hi>Duke</hi> tooke exceptions thereat, affirming <hi>that they knew his minde, and were not ignorant, how to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: with which words</hi> (ſayth the hiſtorie) <hi>the citizens were much troubled: for, quoth they among themſelues, hee would haue vs to proclaime him King, but this ſhall neuer be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way, which hee tooke to ouerthrow the eſtare of the Church, was by countenancing <hi>Iohn Wickliffe,</hi> who, by reaſon of an hypocriticall demeanour among the Common people, had gotten an opinion of <hi>holineſſe.</hi> Hee had liued as a ſecular prieſt; but afterward hee changed his habit, and conuerſed with the Friars mendicants. Hee and his company went bare footed, and in courſe ruſſet garments down to the heeles. They preached eſpecially againſt Monkes, and other religious men that had poſſeſſions: and for this cauſe got in ſome fauour with the Religious, who had no poſſeſſions, and were aſſiſted by them in that cauſe. This <hi>Wickliffe</hi> being called before his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to anſwere for certaine wordes ſpoken by him, was brought in by the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhal</hi> into S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in London, and was bidden by them to ſit downe, as hauing much to anſwere: which when the Biſhop <hi>Courtney</hi> of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vnderſtoode, hee countermanded it. Whereupon the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Marſhall</hi> tooke occaſion of anger againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: and the <hi>Duke</hi> threatned to pull downe both the pride of him and of all the Biſhops of England. He had before cauſed all the goods of the Biſhop <hi>Wickham</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to be ſeized on, and would not ſuffer him to make his anſwere, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted others, who had bene moſt vſed by his father in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Realme. But ſhortly this Biſhop had his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties reſtored vnto him by king <hi>Edward</hi> againſt the Dukes will: and preſently after, the Duke and he were made friends at the very beginning of the reigne of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who ſucceeded King <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And this accord was not onely made betweene them, but alſo betweene the Duke, and the citie. And thus ceaſed that <hi>heate of emulation,</hi> ſo ſoone, as it was begun, and yet it began not, vntill the 50 or 51 yeere
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5209:68"/> of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3: in whoſe 17, 25, 27, &amp; 38 yeres of his reigne, the ſtatutes before cited were begun to be treated of, &amp; made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abridging of prouiſions for dignities from Rome, and the forbidding of Appeales in ſome caſes to Rome: beſides what we brought, concerning the firſt of theſe two points out of a ſtatute made aboue 300 yeres ſince: to wit in the 25 of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt. By which it may appeare that it was treated, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe points, before <hi>Wickliffe</hi> roſe: &amp; how deceitfully theſe matters are layd vpon a <hi>heate of emulation againſt the Clergie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although in the 9 yere of the reign of <hi>K. Rich.</hi> the 2, there was a Bil put vp in the Parliament, againſt the Clergy for their temporalties: the King hearing (ſayth the ſtory) the inordinate cryings out of the Laity, &amp; the iuſt anſweres of the Clergy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the bil ſhould be cancelled, &amp; ſuch inordinate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to ceaſe: &amp; affirmed, that he would preſerue the church, during his time, in as good ſtate, as he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, or in better. And the king, being then not paſt 20 yeeres of age, no doubt but his nobles counſelled him in this his anſwere: which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that at that time the aduerſaries of the Clergy did beare no great ſway in England. In the 18. yeere alſo of his reigne, the Clergie and religious men being oppugned by certaine fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of thoſe hypocritical <hi>Lollards,</hi> the King being in Ireland, &amp; certified therof, haſtened home, and threatned thoſe fellowes, that if they did from thencefoorth fauour the <hi>Lollards,</hi> or in any wiſe comfort them, he would extreamly puniſh them. By which it is euident, that what was enacted; or confirmed by him in the 16 yeere of his reigne, which was two yeres before this, or at other times concerning thoſe points, cannot bee conſtrued to haue bene done by <hi>heate of emulation againſt the Clergie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> alſo the fourth, who was ſonne of <hi>Iohn of Gaunt,</hi> and ſucceeded King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, was ſo great an enemy to theſe <hi>Lollards,</hi> as in the beginning of his reigne at a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held in <hi>London,</hi> he made a ſtatute againſt them: wherein it was enacted, that they ſhould be apprehended, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe: and if they were found ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, they ſhould be degraded, and committed to the ſecular iuriſdiction, to be executed. And in the fifth yere of his reigne, when ſome to relieue his want, made a motion in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5209:69"/> to haue the Clergie depriued of their temporalties, and <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> had giuen his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary, the king and his Nobles ſtood for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and thoſe knights of the parliament, who were actors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Clergie, were brought to confeſſe their offence, and to aske forgiueneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>To conclude, no one of theſe ſtatutes were euer repealed by any of our princes Catholike, or other, which concerned thoſe prohibitions of prouiſions from Rome, or pleading of matters out of this Realme, the knowledge whereof did appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kings Court, although ſome particular clauſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the puniſhment of the offenders hath been repealed. As for example: where it was lawfull for any man, or at the leaſt not puniſhable by our lawes, to kill ſuch, as were out of the kings protection, or to be taken as the Kings enemies, by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt theſe ſtatutes. And in the firſt yeere of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> whom the Author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> will bee aſhamed to number amongſt the worſt kings, (for according to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of our Realme, what prerogatiues ſoeuer any kings haue had, they are to be vnderſtood to be fully, and wholly in the Queenes, who come by ſucceſſion to the Crowne) when no doubt theſe ſtatutes were in minde, it was enacted, that all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences made <hi>felonie,</hi> or limitted, or appointed to be within the caſe of <hi>Premunire,</hi> by any act, or actes of Parliament, ſtatute, or ſtatutes made ſithence the firſt day of the firſt yere of the raigne of the late king of famous memory King Henry the eighth, <hi>not being felony before, nor within the caſe of Premunire:</hi> and alſo all, and euery branch, article, and clauſe mentioned, or in any wiſe declared in any of the ſame ſtatutes, concerning the making of any offence, or offences to be <hi>felony,</hi> or within the caſe of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> not being <hi>felonie,</hi> nor within the caſe of <hi>Premunire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and all paines and forfeitures concerning the ſame or any of them ſhould from thenceforth be repealed, and vtterly void, and of none effect. King Henrie the eighth alſo when he was ſo deuoted to the Catholike faith, and particularly to the Sea of Rome, as he gaue monethly 60000 angels, towards the pay of an Armie vnder <hi>Mounſieur de Foy</hi> for the deliuery of Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the 7, when he was holden priſoner in the Caſtel Angel
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5209:69"/> in Rome, by the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> his Armie, and the prince of <hi>Oringe:</hi> Yea, when Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the the tenth eſteemed of him, as of the beſt prince in Chriſtendome, and either to his deſerts, or vnder them, gaue him this glorious title <hi>Defender of the faith:</hi> he did ſo far foorth execute the law of <hi>Premunire</hi> againſt all <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine prouiſions of dignities,</hi> and authority, to be practiſed within his Realme, without his aſſent, as the Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an extraordinary affection in the king towards him, dared not to exerciſe his power Legantine, vntill he was licenced therunto by the king, vnder his hand, and broad ſeale: <note place="margin">Io Stow. 21. Hen 8.</note> which he pleaded, that he had when he was indited afterward in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for his exerciſe thereof. And yet was the king himſelfe a ſutor to the Pope, to giue that authority to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, as may be ſeene in the tenth yeere of his reigne: which was about three yeeres before he was intituled, <hi>Defender of the faith.</hi> But all aſwell princes, as other muſt ſtand to this good fellow his checke: and if they diſpleaſe him, it is enough to haue them accounted in the higheſt degree of badneſſe, how pious, and godly ſoeuer hee eſteemed them before with the ſame breath.</p>
               <p>But now concerning that which is ſayd by the Prieſts, of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Watſon,</hi> that he refuſed, vpon theſe ſtatutes, all externall iuriſdiction offered him ouer his fellowe priſoners, this good fellow ſayth, that <hi>it is most contumelious and falſe.</hi> Whome ſhall we beleeue in this caſe? thoſe who were Prieſts, and fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with him, and were preſent at the offer, and his refuſall, and are eare witneſſes therof; or this peremptorie fellow, who careth not what paſſeth him? But perchance his reaſon may ouerpeaze the relation of theſe witneſſes, although for many reſpects moſt reuerend. <hi>For</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that had bene to deny his Holines Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in England.</hi> Marke (I pray you) this reaſon, and weigh it with that which is before ſaide and ſhewed concerning this point. Card. <hi>Wolſey</hi> would not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his <hi>power Legantine</hi> in England, vntill he had licence of his Maieſtie, as appeareth by his plea before cited: and yet neither the king nor he denied his Holines Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in England; as appeareth by that the king of England made requeſt to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> to conſtitute Card. <hi>Wolſey</hi> his Legate in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5209:70"/> England, and behaued himſelfe ſo Catholikely, as hee was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Defendor of the faith.</hi> Alſo the moſt Catholike Biſhops, who liued in the times of many, and thoſe moſt Catholike Princes without al doubt obſerued the law, yet no way were to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as this peremptory companion would haue them, with a <hi>deniall of his Holines iuriſdiction in England.</hi> And in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden <hi>16. Rich 2.</hi> the Biſhops doe make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>authoritie</hi> in the Pope to excommunicate, and the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> thereof in England. Moreouer, this Doctor <hi>Watſon</hi> when he was made a Biſhop, hee had licence of her Maieſtie, who then was, before he would take vpon him to vſe his Epiſcopall iuriſdiction in England; as he related himſelfe to ſome yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, &amp; of credit. And no doubt this was done vpon the ſame ground (that lawe of <hi>Praemunire</hi> ſtanding in full force in her time, as being neuer repealed, but rather ſuffered voluntarily to ſtand in full force) as may be gathered by an acte <hi>primo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae:</hi> yet no Catholike doubteth, but that her Maieſtie did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Popes authoritie in England, as appeareth by her repealing diuers ſtatutes made by her father, to take away the Popes authority in England; <hi>Anno 1. &amp; 2. Philip. &amp; Mariae.</hi> So that the folly of this fellow is exceeding great in giuing this reaſon, why the Biſhop could not refuſe all externall iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered him from his Holines.</p>
               <p>Againe, although Doctor <hi>Watſon</hi> were Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and had vſed his iuriſdiction in that Dioceſſe by the licence or permiſſion of Queene <hi>Mary:</hi> yet he was neuer Biſh. of <hi>Ely,</hi> in which Dioces theſe priſoners liued, who offered him that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall iuriſdiction: ſo that his refuſing all externall iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer his fellowe priſoners, is no way to be brought within the compaſſe of denying his Holines Eccleſiaſtical iuriſdiction in England. And if his Epiſcopal iuriſdiction were ſo inlarged by his Holines, that he might haue vſed it ouer all England, yet might he moſt iuſtly haue refrained from the preſent exerciſe thereof in that ample maner, hauing neuer had any ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, or aſſent from his Soueraigne, according to that Statute, which was made <hi>25. Edw. 3.</hi> wherein it is enacted, that <hi>firſt the Kings licenſe, to chuſe, was to be demanded, and after election, his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſent was to be had.</hi> And as he was not to expect, that a Prince
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5209:70"/> of a contrary Religion ſhould legitimate any ſuch authoritie in him, ſo he was to aſſure him ſelfe, that a Prince of a contrary Religion would take hold of that Statute againſt him: ſeeing that Princes, who were of the ſame Religion, did both enact it, and cauſe it to be moſt ſtrictly obſerued, and yet they neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his Holines Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in England. And by this it is made moſt manifeſt, how Biſhop <hi>Watſon</hi> might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Epiſcopall iuriſdiction from Rome, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to exerciſe the ſame, without deniall of the Popes Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall iuriſdiction in England any more, then for 200. yeeres together al the Catholike Biſhops in England did before him.</p>
               <p>But I cannot a little marueile, that this authour would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>aſſociation</hi> (intended in England) with this <hi>Archipresby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,</hi> which is ſo pontificall or maieſticall, as the Title (which by vertue thereof he vſeth) is enough to make ſuch meane men as his fellowes are, not to know which way to looke. For thus he writeth himſelfe: <hi>George Blackwell by the grace of God, and the ordinance of the Sea Apoſtolike, Archprieſt of England.</hi> We will put the caſe, that the <hi>aſſociation</hi> intended had gone forward: <hi>but then how</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>would that haue ſtood without externall tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, ſeeing that one of theſe two points they muſt confeſſe, that either they would haue asked confirmation thereof from Rome, and conſequently it would haue beene an externall iuriſdiction as well as this of the Archpr. or elſe they would haue gouerned abſolutely of themſelues, without any dependance or approbation of his Holineſſe? And this had bene a farre worſe inconuenience, to exclude wholly the Sea Apostolicke, for auoiding the statute of</hi> Praemunire. <hi>Wherefore whither this ſpirit tendeth, all men doe ſee.</hi> But fewe men yet doe ſee, whither this ſpirit tendeth: neither muſt they ſo much as aske a queſtion. which may imply a doubt of any thing which this author affirmeth. If the Prieſts muſt confeſſe, that either they muſt <hi>haue asked a confirmation</hi> of their <hi>aſſociation</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, or elſe <hi>haue excluded wholly the Sea Apostolike,</hi> what muſt the eighteene (ſo often ſurnamed <hi>quiet Prieſts of Wisbich</hi>) confeſſe, who ſought no confirmation of their enforcing and violent <hi>agencie</hi> or gouernement vnder F. <hi>Weſton</hi> the Ieſuit? Muſt they confeſſe, that <hi>they did wholly exclude the Sea Apoſtolike?</hi> or had they any priuiledge aboue other Prieſts, to confeſſe that it was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:5209:71"/> not of any neceſſitie for them either to <hi>ſeeke a confirmation from the See Apoſtolike,</hi> or <hi>to exclude it wholly?</hi> Had it not been a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient acknowledging of the authoritie of the See Apoſtolike, if they had alwayes beene ready to haue diſſolued their <hi>aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> vpon notice from his Holines, that he would not haue any ſuch <hi>aſsociation</hi> in England? Is euery dutiful reſpect, which one man or two will cary voluntarily to a third, to be confirmed by the <hi>See Apoſtolike,</hi> or elſe that <hi>See</hi> to be thought <hi>wholly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded?</hi> It is moſt certaine, that the <hi>aſſociation</hi> intended, was of no other, then ſuch as would voluntarily ſubiect themſelues to a courſe of life for their owne both ſpirituall and temporall good, and to do what good they could to all others, although they would not be of that company, as their rules did ſhewe. Cannot this good fellow make a difference between the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in of an <hi>authoritie,</hi> which muſt imply neceſſarily an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iuriſdiction,</hi> and include the accepters thereof within the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> (vnleſſe the prince had accorded vnto it) and the ſending out to haue a liking of a <hi>confraternitie</hi> of prieſts, or <hi>aſſociation,</hi> which might haue beene, whether the Pope had liked it or no, vntill he had forbidden it, it hauing no ſuch title of <hi>dignitie,</hi> as required neceſſarily any acte of the Pope, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall iuriſdiction to erect it, or her Maieſties allowance, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or aſſent, if ſhee had bene of the ſame religion? If there were no other, this title of the <hi>Archprieſt</hi> would make a great difference: <hi>George Blackwell by the grace of God, and the ordinance of the See Apoſtolike, Archprieſt of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This author hauing pleaſed himſelfe in prouing a contempt (as he weeneth) in the prieſts concerning this authority, he ſtil inculcateth, that it was inſtituted by his Holineſſe, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afterward by an expreſſe <hi>Breue,</hi> as though it had bene knowen before the comming of the <hi>Breue,</hi> that his Holineſſe had any part in it, or that any of theſe forementioned matters had bene firſt, or formerly vrged by the prieſts, after that they had full notice of the Popes mind therein, and not rather been only publiſhed afterwards, to the end that all might ſee (who would) what reaſon the prieſtes had to forbeare, to ſubiect themſelues vnto the authority, at the ſight of the Cardinall <hi>Caietans</hi> letters. And whereas hee would after ſhew out of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:5209:71"/> prieſts their owne words, how dangerouſly they doe teach diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to this authoritie, and to all other, which they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: and in the margent putteth this note: <hi>Dangerous and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue doctrine:</hi> he doth infinitely diſcredit himſelfe: the doctrine as he hath here deliuered it, being ſo ſound and Catholike, as whoſoeuer ſhall gaineſay it, will prooue himſelfe <hi>an Aſſe</hi> or <hi>an heretike.</hi> Neither can his malicious deſcant vpon theſe words, which he citeth, preuaile in the iudgement of any, who hath iudgement. As for example, that <hi>by this doctrine men are taught, to examine euery thing, comming from their</hi> Superiors, <hi>by their owne iudgements, and to admit, what they pleaſe, and leaue the reſt:</hi> For the diſcourſe, from whence theſe words are taken, which are here cited, doth plainely ſhew, that the prieſts relied vpon the iudgement of many learned men from beyond the Seas. And whereas the prieſts their wordes are theſe: that <hi>no man is bound in all things to beleeue, or execute what euery man in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer him ſhall put vpon him:</hi> he peruerteth this ſentence, and telleth his reader, that <hi>the prieſts doe teach that euery thing muſt be examined:</hi> which the prieſts neuer affirmed: or <hi>that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſhould be admitted.</hi> And in this matter of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> which was not euery thing, but one ſpeciall thing, and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they relied vpon the <hi>cenſure of Paris</hi> as all men do know, which cleared them from it, and alſo from ſinne: from which alſo his Holineſſe hath now declared that they were free, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> was an Archprieſt, &amp; a <hi>Superior,</hi> and ſtood moſt peremptorily in that error: And by his being in authoritie, countenanced ſuch his forward adherents, as by their audaciouſnes in this preſent controuerſie haue giuen ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that they will be moſt ready, if occaſion be offered, to raiſe a moſt dangerous faction againſt the Clergie, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of duety, or correſpondence in good deſert toward them. And to the queſtion mooued here in the <hi>Apologie, what other way did hereſie take at the beginning againſt Eccleſiaſticall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or what other gate did ſome vnquiet and diſobedient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in thoſe dayes open to hereſie: who being offended with their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, taught, that their ſubiects in conſcience might diſſent from them, and diſobey them in diuers caſes?</hi> I anſwere that <hi>hereſie</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found her way into the world by trueth, or Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5209:72"/> (as that is which is cited here in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> out of the prieſts bookes, and moſt ignorantly (to cenſure it no worſe) oppugned by this author) but by falſhood, after that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were caried away with an opinion, that this or that man could not erre, and that all muſt be true, which this or that man ſayd. And perchance the fowleſt blocke, at which many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes at this day doe ſtumble, is a ſuppoſed doctrine, which (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this <hi>Apologie</hi> came forth) was neuer fauoured by any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and that is: that there are ſome, who in reſpect that they are in ſuch place of authority, cannot erre in any thing; which being ſo apparantly abſurd, as all Catholike hiſtories may conuince the contrary, ſome that heare it, doe reſolue themſelues, that all the reſt is naught. Neither is the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iuſt, which is here taken againſt the prieſts: to wit, <hi>that they did teach this doctrine in generall without any particulars,</hi> although they might haue done it, without offence to any (but to ſuch as hope by their egregious flatterly &amp; ſycophancie to preuaile in that, after which they haue long gaped) for the prieſts deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this doctrine vpon occaſion of the controuerſie of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and proued by this doctrine, that the credit of the Archprieſt, as Archpr. was not ſufficient to conuince, that it was <hi>ſchiſme:</hi> and added in moſt plaine and particular tearmes, as much as was needfull for this place, for the credit of the chiefe paſtour in theſe words: <hi>And who vpon earth is warranted from erring, but one?</hi> To which, to take away the ſcandall, which vpon ſome ſpeaches of ſuch ſycophants, as this author is, hath growen in Chriſtendome among the ſimpler ſort of people, theſe words are moſt Catholikely and truely added, <hi>and not he in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The exceptions which afterward are taken for <hi>vnkindneſſe</hi> towards the Cardinal <hi>Caietane,</hi> are very fooliſh: and thoſe that are for <hi>irreuerence</hi> are as falſe; the prieſts hauing always ſhewed aſmuch reuerence, as the Cardinall did deſerue, or they could doe: ſauing their duety to the Cardinals <hi>ſuperiour</hi> and theirs, and the libertie which the Clergie hath in all places of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

But for our purpoſe, and to prooue, that it was alwayes more to haue a libertie by the temporall Prince his lawe, ouer and aboue the libertie which the Clergie had by the decrees of holy Church: ſee I pray you, howe this was thought on, when it was graunted by a <hi>Parliament,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">47 Edw. 3.</note> that the Cathedrall Churches ſhould enioy their elections, and that from thencefoorth the King ſhould not write againſt the elected, but ſhould by his letters helpe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their confirmation. But (ſayth <hi>Iohn Stowe</hi>) this ſtatute tooke ſmall effect. By which it is euident, that the Clergie did finde, that it was more to haue the decrees <hi>of the Pope and King,</hi> then the decrees of the <hi>Pope alone.</hi> But if this fellow will ſay, that two are not more then one, his Reader muſt take it for an Oracle, and by vertue of <hi>blinde obedience</hi> beleeue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly.</p>

               <p>In the next point, this author iuggleth vp two matters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the one <hi>that the Priests doe call into ſuſpition of forgery the Popes</hi> Breue <hi>it ſelfe:</hi> the other is, <hi>that they draw his Hol. pious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into matter of State.</hi> For proofe of the firſt he citeth theſe words out of the Engliſh booke: <hi>that it was procured God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of what office:</hi> which words cannot by any, but an euill diſpoſition be brought to an accuſation of <hi>forgerie:</hi> The moſt that can be made of it is, that <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> might be ſuſpected to haue procured it, where hee might haue his will perchance more then was conuenient; and yet the <hi>Breue not forged.</hi> For as <hi>Rebuffus in praxi beneficiorum, de breui Apoſtolico numero 16.</hi> doeth note: an Apoſtolicall <hi>Breue, ſolet concedi &amp; à Papa, &amp; à Cancellaria, ac à ſummo paenitentiario, &amp; horum quodlibes dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Apoſtolicum, &amp; ſic</hi> Breuia <hi>dicuntur literae Apostolicae.

               </p>
               <p>Hauing then thus ſhewed that <hi>Breues</hi> may come from diuers Courts, and yet be true <hi>Breues,</hi> we haue alſo ſhewed, that the Prieſts are here falſly accuſed, where they are ſaid to bring the <hi>Breue in ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of forgery,</hi> by making a doubt, out of what court it was procured. But to giue further ſatisfaction to the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The cauſe why a doubt was made of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> his cariage in this matter, is (as we haue ſet it down in the booke dedicated to the holy Office pag. 59) for that the <hi>Breue</hi> affirmed that M. <hi>George Blackwell was appointed by the Cardinals letters of the 7. of March 1598 Archp. of the Engliſh Catholicks, for the better vnion of the Catholicks of the kingdomes of England and Scotland;</hi> whereas in theſe the Cardinals letters he is not made archprieſt <hi>of the Engliſh Catholicks,</hi> but onely <hi>of Priests,</hi> and not of all the prieſts, but onely <hi>of the Prieſts of the Seminaries.</hi> And we did more eaſily giue conſent to thinke, that <hi>Fa.

There is a Cardinall skilfull in the Lawe</hi> (ſaith Zecchius) <hi>who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ouer the office of the</hi> Breues, <hi>who hauing leaue immediatly from the Popes owne mouth, or by the relation of ſome other, without any other warrant from him, and without the ſupplication, but onely hauing a ſmall abbreuiation of the</hi> Breues, <hi>vieweth the forme of the</hi> Breue, <hi>addeth or diminiſheth thereof, as it ſhall pleaſe him, and when he hath viewed his ſmall abbreuiation of the</hi> Breue <hi>and ſet his hand vnto it, be deliuereth it backe to thoſe, who preſented it vnto him, and ſo it is carried as warranted, to thoſe to whom it belongeth to make the</hi> Breues. <hi>Hereupon are letters framed in forme of a</hi> Breue, <hi>and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in thinne parchment, and being written, they are ſealed with waxe vnder the Popes ſcale called</hi> annulus Piſcatoris, <hi>by the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Secretaries, and their writers almoſt alwayes; and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched, they are giuen backe to thoſe who wait for them, paying the dueties according to the nature of the matter, and the hire or reward for the writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now lay theſe matters together: firſt how that <hi>Breues</hi> be made, and his Hol. neuer readeth them, nor yet the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall who is preſident or chiefe in the office, after that he hath giuen his warrant for the drawing of the <hi>Breue,</hi> according to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:5209:74"/> that which was ſhewed to him by the abbreuiator, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ought of the matter, but what the procurer thereof ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. Secondly <hi>F. Parſons</hi> induſtry to further the plots, which he hath layd. Thirdly the credit which he hath in Rome, by reaſon of the Spaniſh faction, which he hath many yeres blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſuch ſort, with putting ſo great an Iland as <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or both in their eyes, as they cannot ſee how vainely they waſt themſelues vpon the fooliſh promiſes of ſo meane a man. Fourthly the fault which ſeemeth to be very great in the <hi>Breue,</hi> where it referreth vs for proofe of a matter to a letter, which doth not conteine that which the <hi>Breue</hi> ſaieth it doth. Fiftly that it may come from diuers offices, and no man can with reaſon blame the prieſts if they haue ſome doubt of the maner of procuring this <hi>Breue,</hi> and alſo affirme thus much, <hi>God knoweth out of what office it was procured:</hi> Not accuſing it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of <hi>forgerie,</hi> as this authour moſt iniuriouſly, and falſly taxeth them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the other accuſation, that <hi>the Priests doe ſeeke to drawe his Holineſse pious meaning into matters of State:</hi> I anſwere, that <hi>his Holineſſe pious meaning</hi> was not knowen, or that he had any part in the inſtitution of this authoritie, vntill his <hi>Breue</hi> came. And if ſince this time, by the Ieſuites meanes, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his Holineſſe hath by any acte in <hi>Ireland</hi> or otherwiſe, giuen the Councell cauſe to thinke that hee dealeth in State matters, the prieſts in England are not to be charged with that which may thereupon fall out. And it is ſaid that it hath bene confeſſed by ſome, who are in hold now in England, that ſuch a conceite was currant in Spaine, that this Archipresbyterie was made for the furtherance of ſome State plots againſt our Countrey, which at that time perchance was concealed from his Holineſſe, and a fayrer tale told him of <hi>pietie,</hi> to winne him to inſtitute it at their inſtance: who hoping to get therby, what they deſired, would in time bring the <hi>Church gouernement</hi> into a company of <hi>blind-deuout-obedient</hi> children vnder ſome <hi>elder,</hi> or ſome <hi>Agent,</hi> which had beene to take away all <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie,</hi> and ancient approued gouernment in our Church. But as it hath bene often ſayd, and is confeſſed in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> the <hi>Breue</hi> came not in a yeere after the inſtitution of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:5209:74"/> And therefore theſe are very malicious accuſations, and conſtructions of the prieſts their words, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or ſpoken, when they knew no other, then that all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> at the inſtance of the Ieſuites, whoſe troubleſome and ſeditious State-humors were too well knowen in England, and gaue too much cauſe to ſay more then euer the prieſts as yet haue ſaid in this kind.</p>
               <p>But now to make an end of this ſecond chapter, this author citeth an other propoſition out of the Engliſh booke, that is: <hi>that confirmation is either most neceſſary in time of perſecution, or altogether vaine, and as a ſuperfluous ceremony in Gods Church.</hi> Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which aſſertion thus he runneth: <hi>which is a very temerarious and ſcandalous ſpeech, not to cenſure it any further, but to leaue it to whom it belongeth.</hi> But yet he will haue a blow or two at the legges of it at the leaſt. Let vs ſee his play, <hi>for that the wordes</hi> vaine and ſuperfluous ceremony, <hi>are contemptuous phraſes of the heretikes.</hi> In good time good ſir: and you by this haue giuen vs ſome light, how it could be poſſible, that you ſhould goe ſo farre out of the way as you doe, not only here, but euery where in this <hi>Apologie.</hi> You haue read, as we take it, that ſaying of <hi>Elias, Siautem Baal, ſequimini illum. If Baal be God, follow him.</hi> Thoſe latter words doe beſt ſerue your turne, the whole propoſition is too heauie for you. Can you find in any of the prieſts books, where they ſay, that <hi>the ſacrament of confirmation is a vaine and ſuperfluous ceremony?</hi> If you can, then cite the place, and you ſhall haue humble thankes for your paynes, and ſhall thereby alſo put the prieſts in mind of ſuch their <hi>temerarious, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous propoſitions.</hi> If you cannot (as we are moſt ſure that you cannot) then muſt you not be offended, if we thinke that you ſet vp your reſt vpon <hi>Sequimini illum,</hi> the following of <hi>Baal,</hi> and that your company will ſuite better with beaſts, then with men, vpon whoſe laſt words, none but ſuch <hi>ſenſeleſse ecchoes</hi> doe take aduantage. His Reader being preiudicially poſſeſſed by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the laſt words, he imboldneth himſelfe to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the whole ſentence, to wit: <hi>Neither doth it follow, that albeit his Holineſse and predeceſſours hitherto, haue not thought the vſe of this Sacrament neceſsary in England, during the time of our perſecution (as indeede to no man in any time is it abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5209:75"/> to ſaluation) therfore good Catholikes ſhould eſteeme it for a vaine and ſuperfluous ceremony.</hi> Note I pray you, the pretie ſleights which he vſeth. The prieſts did ſay, that <hi>this Sacrament was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most neceſſary in time of perſecution, or els a vaine ceremonie.</hi> And he telleth vs, that albeit his Holineſſe hath not thought it <hi>neceſsary in England, during the time of our perſecution,</hi> as though his Holineſſe could not thinke, that this Sacrament of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was moſt neceſſarie in the time of perſecution, and yet not iudge it neceſſary here, and now in our perſecution by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch miſinformations, as might be giuen him: as if for example, any ſhould ſay vnto the Pope, as <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> ſaide to M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> at Rome, Why can they not now do aſwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it as heretofore? Or ſome other perchance might put into the Popes head, that which ſome Ieſuites put into ſome of the Catholikes heads in England: <hi>it cannot laſt long now, the next yeere we ſhall haue Maſſe openly in Paules:</hi> or as a Ieſuite hauing once promiſed a gentleman, in recompence of an iniurie done vnto him, to get him a diſpenſation to marry his kinſwoman: and being ſued vnto to remember his promiſe, anſwered, that he vnderſtood that the Card. <hi>Allen</hi> was now vpon his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into England, and would be here ſhortly, and diſpatch by him ſelfe this, and many other ſuch caſes. Vpon how many motiues may a thing, from one ſmall time to an other, bee deferred, which notwithſtanding might bee thought neceſſary? Can any Catholike thinke, that amongſt all Countries chriſtened, onely <hi>England</hi> muſt be depriued of the benefite of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the Sacrament, <hi>which is as properly inſtituted to ſtrengthen Chriſtians in perſecution,</hi> as Baptiſme is to make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, muſt not be granted to the Engliſh, as their caſe ſtandeth? For what els can theſe his words imply: <hi>albeit his Holineſse, and predeceſſors hitherto haue not thought the vſe of this Sacrament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in England, during the time of our perſecution?</hi> Belike then it is neceſſary in time of perſecution: but we in England muſt not haue it. Hath he not well holpen the matter? and as for that fooliſh parentheſis <hi>(as in deede to no man in any time it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> to what end is it here brought? who hath euer ſaid that it is at any time <hi>abſolutely neceſsary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Baptiſme by water is not <hi>abſolutely neceſsary to ſaluation,</hi> as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:5209:75"/> ſome Martyrs haue prooued, and yet our Sauiour ſaith, <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnleſſe a man be borne againe by water, and the holy Ghoſt, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> The like phraſe of ſpeech, implying <hi>neceſsitie,</hi> is vſed by our Sauior concerning the receiuing of the Sacrament of his bodie: and yet no man doth ſay, <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> that it is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſaluation.</hi> This queſtion was not, whether the Sacrament of confirmation was <hi>abſolutely neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> for this muſt haue ſet a ſtint vpon the power of God: but the queſtion was, whether that confirmation were <hi>neceſsary in time of perſecution</hi> in Spaine (if you will) when God ſhall ſuffer it, or in Italy, if in England and in the Engliſh perſecution it be not thought neceſſary. And if it can be prooued, that at the leaſt ſomewhere this Sacrament is <hi>neceſſarie in the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> the propoſition, which the prieſtes did make, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> nor <hi>temerarious,</hi> nor <hi>falſe doctrine:</hi> it being eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all men of ſenſe, that the one part of a diſiunctiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition being true, the whole propoſition is true. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a man ſay of a Swanne, this Swanne is either white or blacke: His propoſition is ſo true, as no man of any ſenſe can deny it: although it were a moſt ridiculous aſſertion to ſay, that the Swan were blacke. If then we can proue, that confirmation is <hi>moſt neceſſarie in time of perſecution,</hi> he would be prooued to haue bene ouer haſtie, who ſnatched ſo greedily at this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: <hi>It is either moſt neceſsary in time of perſecution, or a vaine and ſuperfluous ceremony in Gods Church.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition is euident by light of nature. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition is ſo generally receiued of all Catholike Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, as they doe <hi>anathematize</hi> whoſoeuer denyeth it, and it is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:5209:76"/> made plaine by induction: For in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> wee receiue grace for remiſſion of <hi>originall ſinne,</hi> and all other, if we haue any at the receiuing of that Sacrament: but we doe not receiue any ſpeciall grace to reſiſt the perſecutor: and ſo likewiſe doe wee receiue grace to ſuch, and ſuch particular end, by all the other Sacraments. But the grace by which wee are ſtrengthened to combat with the perſecutor, is only giuen, &amp; vnder this name, by the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> And for this cauſe doeth Pope <hi>Vrbane,</hi> as he is cited <hi>de Conſecra. dist. 5. cap. 1.</hi> affirme, that <hi>all Chriſtians must be confirmed:</hi> and in the ſame place <hi>Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the Pope is cited, who affirmeth, that <hi>the helpes, which wee haue by Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are neceſsary for thoſe who liue:</hi> for in his time all Chriſtians liued in perſecution. <hi>Hoſius</hi> citeth this Epiſtle of <hi>Melchiades</hi> more at large in his booke entituled <hi>Confeſsio Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae fidei Chriſtianae, cap. 38.</hi> where the Pope compareth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> to the admiſſion into a warrefare; and the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> to the furniture for the battaile. And to ſhew further how neceſſary this Sacrament is in time of perſecution, he applyeth to it that ſaying, <hi>Niſi Dominus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodierit ciuitatem &amp;c. vnleſſe the Lord keepe the citie, he watcheth in vaine who keepeth it.</hi> And afterwards to this doubt, <hi>what did the comming of the holy Ghoſt profit the Apoſtles, after the paſsion and reſurrection of Christ?</hi> He maketh this anſwer, that <hi>thereby they were made able to that, to which they were not before: for that before the comming of the holy Ghoſt, the Apostles for very feare denyed Chriſt: but after that the holy Ghoſt was come vnto them, they were armed to ſuffer martyrdome.</hi> And to conclude, this Pope telleth vs, that by this ſacrament we obtaine, amongſt other gifts, that gift of <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> of which it is ſaid. <hi>Intellectum tibidabo, &amp;c. I wil giue thee vnderſtanding, and inſtruct thee in this way in which thou goeſt.</hi> The ſame <hi>Hoſius</hi> in the ſame Chapter citeth <hi>S. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who ſucceeded S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who attributeth the fall of <hi>Nouatus</hi> the heretike, to the want of this Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation:</hi> for <hi>Nouatus</hi> falling dangerouſly ſicke, after that he was diſpoſſeſſed, was <hi>baptized,</hi> but not <hi>confirmed,</hi> as he ought to haue bene, according to the rule of the Church. This Epiſtle is in the 6. booke of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie. <hi>cap. 43.</hi> By theſe and other the like doth <hi>Hoſius</hi> prooue, that <hi>baptiſme</hi> is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5209:76"/> for thoſe that come in; <hi>confirmation,</hi> for thoſe who fight. King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. in his book againſt <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> hauing diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon this Sacrament, citeth thoſe wordes out of <hi>Hugo de S. Victore. Illic gratia tribuitur adremiſsionem peccatorum, hîc gratia datur ad confirmationem: Quid autem prodeſt ſi à lapſu erigeris, niſi ad ſtandum confirmeris?</hi> That is, <hi>There</hi> (that is, by baptiſme) <hi>is grace giuen for the remiſsion of ſinnes: here</hi> (that is, by confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>is grace giuen for ſtrengthening: For what profiteth it you to be raiſed after a fall, if you are not confirmed or made ſtrong to ſtand?</hi> And a little after ſayth the King: <hi>Ad hoc enim ordinatur: It is ordained to this end, that a man may boldly confeſſe his faith before the perſecutor.</hi> And to make here an end of this diſcourſe, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10 gaue vnto the King for this booke, this Title, <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the faith.</hi> And if there were no other proofe of the <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie</hi> of this Sacrament in time of perſecution, that which is here cited out of <hi>Hugo,</hi> and ſo highly commended by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> were ſufficient for a farre better man then the fault-finding <hi>Apologie-maker:</hi> and to conuince him, that the propoſition which the prieſts vſed, was neither <hi>words of great exceſſe,</hi> nor <hi>contained falſe doctrine,</hi> nor <hi>was reprochfull to his Holineſſe, or his predeceſsors:</hi> who could not but know, that <hi>confirmation was moſt neceſſarie in time of perſecution,</hi> howſoeuer they were perſwaded by ſome our backe-friends, that it was not neceſſarie in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, during the time of our perſecution. And thus much in anſwere to the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> wherein the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth ſufficiently diſcouer by his proud and peremptorie iudgements, whither his ſpirit tendeth: and that his hope to preuaile with his reader, is founded more vpon contumelious words and falſe imaginations, then vpon ſound diſcourſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the third Chapter this Authour intendeth, firſt, to ſhew <hi>the great iniuries and ingratitude of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the whole body of the ſociety:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>how pleaſing and profitable this is to heretikes:</hi> thirdly, <hi>how preiudiciall and diſhonourable to all our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nation and cauſe:</hi> three very materiall points, were they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The prieſts doe ſhew all theſe things moſt plainely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ieſuits and their adherents in this action. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prieſts did raiſe <hi>a very reuerend opinion of the Ieſuits in the hearts of the Engliſh</hi> (as Fa. <hi>Campion</hi> in his letters to his generall, confeſſeth) <hi>and ſuch, as without feare hee could not recount it,</hi> the Ieſuits being by theſe meanes wrought into credite, wrought the prieſts out ſo far, as in many places no prieſt was welcome, who came not by order of a Ieſuite: and hauing gotten an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage (as they thought) of the Prieſts, followed it to the prieſts great diſquiet, although in the end it will turne to their owne vtter diſcredite, as already it beginneth, and their beſt friends doe ſee it, and wiſh too late, that their treatiſe of <hi>Schiſme</hi> againſt the Prieſts had neuer bene written. The commending of which treatiſe by their fellow Ieſuits, or the not puniſhing of ſo famous a libeller, hath iuſtly drawen on a hard conceit of the whole body, eſpecially the ſuperiour of the ſociety, who in conſcience ſhould haue corrected ſo foule a fault, and chiefe root, from whence doeth ſpring the preſent diſquietneſſe in England among the Catholikes, and a very profitable pleaſure to the Proteſtants, who cannot but laugh at this ſinnefull folly of the Ieſuits, while by libels they would poſſeſſe al Catholikes, that the prieſts, who reconciled them to the vnion of Gods Church, were now themſelues become <hi>Schiſmatikes,</hi> the moſt preiudiciall and diſhonourable calumniation, that euer was raiſed againſt our Catholikes, and the Catholike faith.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:5209:77"/>
               <p>And for the further vexation of the prieſts, this author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in this third Chapter, to bring them into the higheſt degree of <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>hatred:</hi> he endeuoureth to bring them into <hi>contempt,</hi> by telling his reader, that they went ouer-Sea ſome of them <hi>poore ſeruing-men, other ſouldiers, other wanderers in the world;</hi> good ſtuffe to make prieſts of, whom Catholiks are to reuerence, and at whoſe feet Princes are to kneele. And although our Sauiour made his choice of his Apoſtles out of the meaner ſort of men, to giue vs to vnderſtand that it was their function which was honourable in them, yet theſe words in this place might for diuers reſpects haue bene ſpared. Firſt, for that if any ſuch be among them, it is litle for the Ieſuits cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who procure them to take orders. Secondly, becauſe theſe who are named to haue bene the authors of the bookes, againſt which this <hi>Apologie</hi> is written, and ſeeme by this diſcourſe to be here girded at, haue ſome of them left more, to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to that calling, in which they are, then all our Engliſh Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits haue done: others are ſo abundantly prouided for out of their owne patrimonies, as they do maintaine diuers others of their friends: Others (if al their worſhipful friends ſhould haue failed them) were ſo well placed in the Vniuerſities of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as they needed not to haue come to any ſuch bare eſtate as to become <hi>poore ſeruing men, ſouldiers, or wanderers:</hi> And he, who was worſt of them all prouided for, was a ſcholler of good fame, and ſo might haue liued in ſuch ſort, as he neither needed to <hi>ſerue</hi> in this maner, or to <hi>wander</hi> in a ſtrange country. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> (if he be not miſtaken) had he not helped himſelfe with his pupils money, with which he was put in truſt for his pupils vſe, might haue bene <hi>a poore ſeruing man</hi> in ſome ſtrange countrey, or <hi>a ſouldier,</hi> or <hi>a wanderer,</hi> not hauing any honeſt place of abode in England. For being expulſed with infamie out of his Colledge at <hi>Oxeford,</hi> and thereby made deſtitute where to become in England, reſolued to trauaile and to ſtudy <hi>Phiſicke</hi> in <hi>Padua,</hi> where in a ſhort time his money failing him, which his pupils lent him againſt their wils, <hi>want</hi> wrought ſuch a deuotion in him, as he was contented to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the Ieſuits in ſuch ſort, as here in generall termes he affirmeth of the prieſts. Fourthly, if the remembrance of ſir
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5209:78"/> 
                  <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and of other good ſouldiers, and zealous men for the Ieſuits, could not haue obteined of this author, not to haue ſpoken ſo contemptuouſly of ſouldiers, and to diſcredit ſome of his cloſeſt adherents; yet the remembrance of <hi>F. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Loiola,</hi> the founder of the Ieſuits, ſhould haue made him beare a greater reuerence to the name of a ſouldier. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he meaneth to keepe himſelfe well ynough out of his ſight, and we feare it greatly, that <hi>F. Ignatius</hi> wil haue litle ioy to looke vpon him, vnleſſe hee fall to repentance of theſe his bad dealings.</p>
               <p>And whereas he affirmeth, that <hi>probably ſome of thoſe</hi> which he calleth heads of the faction, <hi>had neuer bene men of learning, or accompt, or able to write bookes, if the Ieſuits had not bene:</hi> It is well knowen, that ſome of thoſe whom he by-nameth were neuer the better by the Ieſuits: ſome ſo little, as little might be: and al of them might haue bin <hi>probably men</hi> of more learning, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, &amp; better able to write books, if they had neuer knowen the Ieſuits, then now they are: hauing had more hinderance by them, then furtherance, while vnder colour of prudent and neceſſay mortification, thoſe who would not liſten to the ſpirit which called them to be Ieſuits, were enforced to ſpend their time with leſſe quietneſſe, and conſequently with leſſe profit, then otherwiſe they might. Neither is it here needfull to ſtand vpon the Catholiks their bluſhing, to aske helpe now of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits: for their helps are, as they haue bene a long time (as wee feare) vpon ſuch conditions, as all honeſt men muſt bluſh, if they doe aske them, and thoſe, who are as ready to further the Ieſuits plots; as themſelues (a notable abuſe of the Catholike King his charitie to poore Catholicks) are neither driuen to aske help, nor to bluſh, when they take it: although their helpe is ſo prudently offered, as few do ſurfeit vpon it.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus laied his plot to bring the prieſts into <hi>contempt,</hi> now he imploieth himſelfe to bring them into <hi>hatred</hi> with the Catholicks, by affirming, that <hi>they conſpire with the very enemy againſt their owne.</hi> which is moſt falſe: For if matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be in queſtion, the prieſts are ready to ioyne rather with the lewdeſt Catholicke in the world, then with the Proteſtant: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when matters of trecherie againſt their Prince and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:5209:78"/> countrey be handled, they are as ready to defie the plotters thereof, were they the moſt zealous Catholicks in the world. Sure we are, that this author cannot iuſtly challeng vs, that we haue ſwarued one iot from the Catholicke faith: and his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation muſt needs ſound euill in the eares of vpright Iudges, when he ſaith we conſpire <hi>againſt our owne.</hi> I wiſh alſo that it were not too ſure, that the Ieſuits &amp; their adherents haue thruſt themſelues into conſpiracies <hi>againſt their owne,</hi> if either their Prince and their countrey, or Catholicke prieſts be their owne. For it is ſo palpable as euery man may feele it, how they haue thruſt in not onely their aduiſe, but their perſons in actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince and countrey, &amp; againſt Catholicke prieſts. What greater conſpiracie could haue bene made, then hath bene by their ſlanderous tongues, and infamatory libels <hi>of ſchiſme,</hi> diſperſed againſt them? whereby they haue declared, that they haue giuen hands to all ſorts of enemies, aſwel ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as viſible, <hi>againſt their owne,</hi> in which their vnion the prieſts haue no reaſon to ioyne themſelues.</p>
               <p>Now do follow certaine exceptions againſt ſome marginall notes made in the book dedicated to his Holines. For example in the 23 page, there is this note in the margent, <hi>Ieſuitae quaeſua ſunt quaerunt,</hi> which this author Engliſheth thus, <hi>Ieſuits ſeek their owne, and not thoſe things which are of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which is more, then is in the <hi>Latin,</hi> or perchance more then was meant by that <hi>Latine,</hi> or could be honeſtly gathered, the prieſts not citing the place of Scripture to which this author alludeth. And vpon his owne addition hee diſcourſeth ſomewhat in the ende of this Chapter, &amp; concludeth, that <hi>they haue ſought thoſe things which are of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The error then was, that the prieſts put this word <hi>ſua,</hi> where they ſhould haue put <hi>Ieſu Chriſti</hi> &amp; haue made the note more true in this maner: <hi>the Ieſuits ſeeke thoſe things, which are of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> for belike the Ieſuits haue no liſt to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie themſelues, where nothing is to be had, which they muſt doe if they ſeeke <hi>ſua, their owne.</hi> They doe rather ſeeke, where there are ſome great ſummes of money to be beſtowed vpon the poore Catholicks &amp; prieſts, who are in want: which almes are <hi>Ieſu Christi, belonging to Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and the note had ſtood ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to this ſence, <hi>Ieſuitae quae Ieſu Chriſti ſunt quaerunt. The
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:5209:79"/> Ieſuits doe ſeeke thoſe things which are Ieſu Chriſts.</hi> The other notes this fellow calleth them trifles, &amp; he might very well haue left them, as many other: For he doeth but ſtirre vp a deſire in the Reader to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the booke, whence theſe notes were taken: where he ſhall finde matter ynough, to make more diſpleaſing notes, then theſe are which are here picked out. Yet that note, concerning the Seminaries, muſt in no caſe bee omitted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath bene often anſwered, that they are more to the benefit of the Ieſuits, then to England; hauing therein ſuch, as they vſe, or abuſe rather, for the furthering of their preſent ſtate-plots, &amp; a good aſſurance, that the Colledges in Spaine are to fal to their ſhare hereafter. The lamentable ſtate, into which the colledge of Rome is brought, wil be declared at large in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe therof: The college of <hi>Doway</hi> is brought into theſe termes, vnder pretence of pouertie, as no man is to be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is not great hope, that he will become of the Ieſuits faction. The Cardinal <hi>Protector</hi> willed perchance, that there ſhould be a ſtint vntil the debts were payd: &amp; this is vſed for a colour, to admit, or reiect, whom the Ieſuits liſt. If one be preſented thither, whom the Ieſuits like not, then the colledge debts are to be paid: if it be one, who is likely to be factious for them, the Colledge hath credit for his admittance. And if he be one whoſe friends wil maintein him, then he ſhal go to <hi>S. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> after ſome circumſtances, where the Ieſuits wil haue care for the pious diſtribution of that which he hath: and nothing is ought worth, which hath not ſome great prouidence, or pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at one end thereof.</p>
               <p>To conclude, In this chapter the author doeth litle other then weary his reader, with thoſe idle matters, which he hath before brought, to proue <hi>emulation</hi> and <hi>faction</hi> in all places, and actions, where Ieſuits haue had any thing to doe: and to the oſtentation of the Ieſuits actions, he addeth ſome litle of the zeale of the prieſts, which would proue, that the good prieſts dwelt farre from good neighbours, if <hi>I thinke fol. 21,</hi> and ſuch like ſlips, did not diſcharge the <hi>vnited Prieſts</hi> from all the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of writing this <hi>Apologie,</hi> as by the title he would that the Reader ſhould beleeue,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the fourth Chapter of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intendeth to ſhew how greatly the Card. <hi>Allen,</hi> and others of our nation are iniuried, by being ſaid to haue bene againſt the Ieſuits, and what iniurie is alſo offered to the Cardinals <hi>Borromaeo</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> and his Holines himſelfe. And for his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium,</hi> hee declareth how all ſorts doe ſeeke companie, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and authorize their actions. Belike it was not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as yet, how the Ieſuits haue canuaſed, not onely in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders amonſt <hi>the ſouldiers, religious women,</hi> and <hi>artificers,</hi> for voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in commendation of themſelues, but alſo here in England: hoping that the number of ſuch as can be gotten by <hi>bribes, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> or <hi>threats,</hi> may in time ouerpeaſe the trueth of the cauſe now in controuerſie. The firſt proofe which is here brought to declare the Card. <hi>Allen</hi> his loue and affection to the Ieſuites, is out of his letter written to M. <hi>Muſh:</hi> of which wee haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed before, and ſhewed how little it can make for the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. All the other alſo here cited make as little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, this preſent controuerſie being long after the Cardinals death: to wit, whether the prieſts (who would not be <hi>blinde obedient</hi> vpon the ſight of Card. <hi>Caietane</hi> his letters for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Archprieſt) were <hi>ſchiſmatikes, factious, ſeditious, rebellious, fallen from Chriſt and his ſpouſe, excommunicated, irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, witches and Idolaters, and as Ethnicks, and Publicans?</hi> In which controuerſie, if any of thoſe ſtand with vs, who ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues contrary to the Cardinals proceedings, while he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Ieſuits, and brought into diſhonourable actions againſt his Prince, countrey, and friends, what reaſon haue we to reiect their helpe? And if they had bene as bad as heretikes in thoſe actions, why ſhould we be charged as partners in that action, more then any Catholike prince may be charged to be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:5209:80"/> a fauourer of heretikes or miſcreants, who ſhould haue any ſuch ioyned with him in his armie, either for loue or money, when hee fighteth againſt ſome other Catholike prince, vpon iniuries offered by the one to the other. Thoſe Noble men, Gentlemen, and others whileſt they liued, were ready to giue account of their actions in thoſe times, and ſome will yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance vpon this occaſion, ſay ſomewhat therin: and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall might ſhewe himſelfe very contrary vnto them in thoſe actions, and yet be very fauourable to the ſtudents in Rome, towards the latter end of his life, when time let him ſee thoſe things in the Ieſuits proceedings, which either affection would not let him ſee before, or little hope to amend them, made him diſſemble, which perchance he did the rather, becauſe by the Ieſuits meanes with the King of Spaine, hee came to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrement which he held, and could not ſo ſuddenly goe about to reforme, what he ſaw amiſſe in their gouernment of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Colledge, and their generall cariage in Engliſh affaires.</p>
               <p>The feares and doubts which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhewed in his letter to M. <hi>Tho. Fitzherbert</hi> doe diſcouer, that D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with them, as may be gathered by the bolde carriage of ſuch, as ſtand with them and their impatient violence, which leaueth no doubt to any how they are caried: and this doctor hauing bene once of their ſocietie, and going out from them, might iuſtly feare that it would haue beene laid wholly in his diſh, if he had declared his mind in any publicke ſort, as he did often priuatly to ſuch, as he thought he might complaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, without harme to himſelfe. He was alſo a man of that marke and merit aboue all the reſt of our nation, as it was expected he ſhould haue come to ſome great preferrement, which hee was ſure that his manifeſting himſelfe would haue hindered. And this was alſo an occaſion of Do. <hi>Barrets</hi> diſſembling, of whoſe minde there are many witneſſes in England: and of his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, for his oppoſing himſelfe againſt ſuch, as he confeſſed were the onely men with whome hee durſt deale confidently. And although it pleaſeth this deuout ſpirit, to taxe ſuch, as he ſayth are of the faction, that they are <hi>a fewe of the meaner ſort of our nation,</hi> and that <hi>they carry their knowen notes of diſcredit with them, if they be examined:</hi> he who ſhall examine it ſhall find the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:5209:80"/> cleane contrary both in England and out of England: and that the Ieſuits faction is held vp by ſuch only, as ſeeing the liberty which the Ieſuits &amp; their adherents do vſe againſt the prieſts, or hoping of ſome reward by them, do feare to diſpleaſe them. Which folly, were it once remooued, the Ieſuits and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents would appeare to be <hi>ſicut caeteri homines: as other men are:</hi> (notwithſtanding this phariſaicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the prieſts) and perchance much worſe, euen to the equalling of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> who carieth his openly <hi>knowen notes of diſcredit,</hi> for the which he was expulſed the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and are not yet diſplayed as they may be hereafter, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be giuen; but are as much laughed at in priuate by ſome, as his counterfeit holineſſe is admired by other.</p>
               <p>The iniurie which the prieſts are ſayde to haue done to the Card. <hi>Borromaeo,</hi> Archb. of <hi>Millan,</hi> conſiſteth in their affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>he tooke the gouernement of one of his Seminaries in</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan <hi>from the</hi> Fathers. This might be an iniury to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> if the Card. did it without iuſt cauſe: but being done, the caſe is to be diſcuſſed whether it were iuſt or no. And the Cardinall being knowen to be a moſt deuout Biſhop, and not likely to haue bene caried away with any fooliſh paſſion in a matter of ſo great moment, the prieſts haue layd the blame vpon the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits their miſgouernement. And further they ſay wherein, to wit, becauſe the Seminarie inſtituted by that deuout Biſhop, for the maintenance of able perſons for the Church vnder his charge, the Ieſuits tooke their pleaſure, and choyſe of ſuch as they thought would be ſome credit vnto their own order, and thereby indeuoured to furniſh themſelues rather then the Church, for which the Seminarie was inſtituted. And they who gaue this cauſe of the Ieſuites their remooue, were well acquainted therewith, and with thoſe Ieſuites, which were thus allured from that ſtate of life, for which they had mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Cardinall. But let vs ſee how this author ſhuffeth off this matter. <hi>The</hi> Fathers <hi>of their owne will, and vpon their owne earneſt ſuite, left the ſaid gouernment for the great labour and trouble thereof.</hi> Good charitable people, who challenge vnto them a particular vocation to bring vp youth, and labour it in all places where they come, as the beſt policie they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5209:81"/> to binde men vnto them, without reſpecting how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are maintained for that purpoſe in the Countrey, or the College, as many other would, and do in Vniuerſities much better cheape, where any Lecture is founded for all commers vnto it. The ſecond ſhift which is here vſed, is farre worſe, although in an other kind: for thereby they draw the Cardinal or themſelues into diſcredit. Forſooth the matter was, <hi>the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall would haue had thoſe his ſchollers more bare in their dyet and apparell, then the</hi> Fathers <hi>order in their Seminaries did permit, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were to be ſent afterwards abroad to poore benefices among countrey people, where they muſt fare hardly.</hi> If the Cardinall did allow ſufficient for them, then had the Ieſuites no cauſe to giue it ouer, vnleſſe perchance they could not content themſelues with that which was ſufficient. If the Cardinall did not allow that which was ſufficient, then was he not of that wiſedome, of which he was reputed to be, neither could any benefice in all his Dioceſſe be ſo beggerly, as that it would not maintaine the Paſtour in ſuch diet, as is ordinarily vſed in the Ieſuites Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries: neither could the Cardinall be ſo ignorant, but he knew he might, nor ſo careleſſe of the credit of a paſtour, but that he would vnite two benefices in one, where one could not ſuffice to maintaine the paſtour, at the leaſt after ſo meane a rate, as we doe conceiue in is kept in diet and apparell in the Ieſuites Seminaries. And this diſlike in the Cardinall, of the Ieſuits gouernement of his Seminarie, might ſtand with an opinion, that many of them were good men, and to bee vſed otherwiſe. As alſo the Cardinall <hi>Tollet</hi> might conceiue of them how euill ſoeuer ſome of them behaued themſelues in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Engliſh College at Rome. Laſtly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the prieſts are here challenged to haue done iniurie to his Holineſſe, for that his exhortation to the Ieſuites in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall congregation is remembred by them, is a very fooliſh conceite of this author, as alſo that he would haue vs to thinke, that his Holineſſe did exhort the <hi>Capuchines</hi> to lay downe their pompe, who are generally knowen to vſe none. But as this authour ſaid at the beginning of this chapter, <hi>All ſorts ſeeke companie,</hi> and of all other, the Ieſuites loue the <hi>Capuchines,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire nothing.</p>

And forſomuch as this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth wholly conſiſt of this point, here is little to bee ſayd thereof, the ſtory being particularly ſet downe by ſuch, as to whom theſe things doe principally appertaine: only theſe few matters are to be noted, that whereas this Author would make ſhew, that the Ieſuites were drawen into the gouernement of that Colledge; there are prieſts yet liuing, who will iuſtifie, that they were ſollicited by the Ieſuits to take them for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: which how willingly ſoeuer, and ſincerely the Students then performed, being caried away (as many yet are, though not ſo faultily, as thoſe who are now deluded therewith) with the religious name of ſome, who little deſerue it: M. <hi>Sherwine</hi> who is here named in this chapter, ſayd not long after in the preſence of ſome, from whoſe mouth wee writ it, that <hi>they had done they know not what.</hi> What would he haue ſaid if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſee this loue vnto the Ieſuits, vſed by the ſame Ieſuits to bring the Secular prieſts into hatred, euen with ſuch, as will they, nill they, muſt take them for their paſtors, as all the world doth, and hath done, and haue proſpered in ſoules health for the ſpace of 1500 yeres, and more, before this <hi>ſociety</hi> ſurnamed of <hi>Ieſus</hi> was begun? And whereas there is a touch here alſo, of ſome troubles rayſed in that Colledge, not long after the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation therof: it is wel knowen, that they grew vpon the Ieſuits their dealings with the ſtudents to become Ieſuits: which how pious ſoeuer the deſire was in the one to diſpoſe, or in the other to attaine to a higher perfection, was a trouble to the reſt, who
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5209:82"/> grew in contempt with the new inſpired, and were much leſſe regarded of the Ieſuits.</p>
               <p>But theſe troubles were quietly ended within the Colledge, after that the Students perceiued that the Ieſuits notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their publike proteſtations to the contrary, did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand practiſe themſelues, &amp; bare ſome others out, which were their chiefe inſtruments in this action. And this is the true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that riddle, which is in more generall tearmes rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſecond chapter of the <hi>Apologie, fol. 170</hi> where (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of M. <hi>Muſh</hi>) the author affirmeth, <hi>that no other thing euer wrought the fathers more trouble in the Colledge, while this man was there, then their ouermuch loue and fauour to him aboue his merits, as other men thought:</hi> to wit, when the Rector was informed, that (hauing at that time deuoted himſelfe to the Ieſuits, as alſo there it is ſufficiently inſinuated) he vſed to perſwade the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to become Ieſuits, and the profes were very euident, the Ieſuits would neuer beleeue it: and their trouble grew by deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſleights to ſaue him from blame, hauing offended in that, for which in publike ſermons, the Ieſuits would often proteſt, whoſoeuer he were that ſhould vſe it, he ſhould be the ſame day turned out of the Colledge. Theſe troubles being ended, and the ſchollers acquieted (as ſeeing no remedy without further trouble) and contented to beare what was offred them by this new ſpirit, which firſt began to be the ouerthrovv of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and now of England: Other began in the time of Pope <hi>Xistus</hi> of holy memorie, and then there was a viſitation made in the Colledge. But what the cauſes were thereof, we doe not vnderſtand. If this authour could doe any thing impudently, doubtleſſe he ſheweth his weakeneſſe in bringing this matter. For as we are informed, thoſe who were reputed the chiefe in that faction, ſince they came into England (not finding belike ſuch among the Secular prieſtes, as could ſort with that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour) haue betaken themſelues to the Ieſuits order, and ſome of them, who are now in England, are as factious in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious humor, as they were buſie before againſt the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious order.</p>

               <p>The extraordinary commendations here brought of F. <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> we wiſh he might deſerue them: and if his life were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie in the <hi>Clinke,</hi> the man had an euil chance to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to <hi>Wisbich,</hi> where his actions are blamed, and prooued blame worthy, at the leaſt in this point very manifeſtly: that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſtirre was likely to grow vpon his <hi>Agencie,</hi> he would not giue it ouer, but would proſecute it, it being a thing which if it had neuer bene thought vpon, might very well haue been miſſed in Gods Church, and no way neceſſary for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation intended by him and his fellowes (as <hi>F. Weston</hi> himſelfe confeſſed in his letter to his <hi>Generall 27. March 1598,</hi> and is here to be ſeene <hi>fol. 77.</hi>) eſpecially without their priuitie, whom hee would ſhould become his ſubiects, or pupils, or how the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue had them called, who (ſetting paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſide) were much fitter to gouerne him, then he them. The cauſe of the breach when peace was once made amongſt them, was in the leſuits; for that they would not ſtand to ſuch rules, as were made, but when they liſted; which D. <hi>Norden</hi> taking (as he had iuſt cauſe) in euill part, got away the copie of the rules which the Ieſuits had, and their faction, and would not reſtore them againe vnto them: And for this is he challenged to haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the peace, which in trueth they did breake: and if he tore the paper, or burned it, they tore the rules, and cancelled them before, when they refuſed to ſtand to iudgement, according as the rules betweene them had ordered it. But of this there is not a word ſpoken.</p>
               <p>This authours meaning is, to preuaile if he can by falſhood and couſening of his Reader, &amp; laboureth to make him merry
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:5209:83"/> with now and then ſome fooliſh impertinent matter, as here fol. 82. he telleth him how that <hi>there were ſixe or ſeuen butterics for 13. perſons, they not ſuffering the 20. to haue any. And further</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the party that directed him</hi> (<hi>M.</hi> Muſh) <hi>after hee had ſhewed him all theſe, he brought him to a chimney where alſo there was good ale, and ſaid, here is another buttery: nay ſaid M.</hi> Muſh, <hi>there is the deuill, whereof that place was called afterwardes merily by ſome,</hi> the deuill in a corner. And verily it was a matter worth the laughing at: whoreſon deuill, the chimney was too good a place for him, vnder correction of that zealous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the other 20. that would haue all things in good order, and euery one in their due place, as ſeemed them. For theſe good and vertuous (as they ſay of themſelues in this chapter fol. 65. and therefore may be beleeued in this point, vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they will now diſclaime the company of <hi>the vnited to the Archprieſt,</hi> which are ſaid to be the authors of this <hi>Apologie</hi>) brought their diuell and placed him in the chappell: where what worſhip they did vnto him, either merily, or more ſeriouſly, we leaue it to their owne godlineſſe to explicate. For we ſhould be loath to ſay any more, then what all the world talked: that is, that they made a buttery of the chappel, which is in the caſtle of <hi>Wisbich.</hi> Other many things there are here touched in this chapter, wherein folly and falſhood ſtriue for the maſtery. As where this author telleth his Reader, that the Ieſuites and their faction at <hi>Wisbich</hi> forced none, but ſuch as would willingly put themſelues into their <hi>Academy, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation according to the faſhion, and example of thoſe priuate</hi> congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations <hi>of our</hi> Lady, <hi>allowed by the Sea Apoſtolike in diuers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</hi> A ſtrange liberty doth this authour take to fitton, ſeeing that all men doe know, that the cauſe of breach was, for that ſome would not ſubiect themſelues vnto that <hi>Academy,</hi> which was deviſed by the Ieſuites and their faction: and that this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy</hi> would not eat and drinke with their brethren. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the breach was firſt made publikely knowen, an vnuſuall faſhion, or example in any priuate <hi>congregations</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> or any honeſt company, and neuer perchance heard of before, but among the impurer ſort of heretikes: to which ſeparation, becauſe the leſſer part would not agree, they are charged fol.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5209:84"/> 67. that they were <hi>ſo diuided among themſelues, as in the yere 1597. as one writeth, that they did eate and take their diet in foure ſeuerall places, hauing notwithſtanding driuen out of the common hall by helpe of the Iaylour, the other part, though farre the greater.</hi> But the manner of driuing them out was no other, then that leaſt theſe (the leſſer number) ſhould ſeeme any way to accord to the ſeparation, made by the greater number, they did ſit ſome of them at euery table in the hall; and not vpon any diuiſion, which was amongſt themſelues, as it is here falſely ſuggeſted. For had the Ieſuites faction had but ſo much againſt the leſſer number, that they had flocked together at one table, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould haue bene fathered vpon them, although they neuer dreamed thereof: and this humour of the Ieſuits being knowen vnto them, they vſed to ſit at euery table ſome, becauſe it ſhould be manifeſt, that the other made the ſeparation. Yet was not this altogether done of purpoſe to this end: for they vſed before to ſit at the ſame tables, at which now they ſate But if they had now left thoſe places, and haue ſitten together at any one table, this circumſtance would haue bene euidence enough for their aduerſaries againſt them. There is alſo a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious falſhood in the 68. leafe, where theſe prieſts of <hi>Wisbich</hi> are ſayd to haue bene the firſt that appealed from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Breue,</hi> by which the Cardinal <hi>Caietanes</hi> letters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: whereas they neuer appealed from the <hi>Breue,</hi> but from ſuch grieuances as they haue ſet downe in their Appeale, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the <hi>Breue</hi> is none, as there may bee ſeene. And fol. 76. there is a ſcornefull ſpeech of the degree of <hi>Doctour in Diuinitie:</hi> where ſpeaking of Maſter Doctour <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> thus he ſaith: <hi>and all this ſtirre to make roome to his Doctourſhip:</hi> (a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree wont to be honoured among honeſt Catholike prieſtes) <hi>which God knoweth in what corner of the worlde he got it, and how worthily: but certaine it is, as farre as we are informed, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary commendation of his Superiours he had it not.</hi> God and the world knoweth, that he had his Doctorſhip, at which this ſilly fellow gybeth, in no corner of the world, vnleſſe one of the moſt famous Vniuerſities in Italy, be to be tearmed a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world. For it is well knowen, that hee tooke his Doctourſhip in <hi>Padua,</hi> and hee tooke it ſo woorthily, as this
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5209:84"/> poore fellow might come learne diuinitie of him theſe many yeeres: although his grauitie perchance would thinke much thereof. And it is certaine alſo, howſoeuer this fellow is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he had it <hi>by the ordinary commendation of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,</hi> who at that time was no other, then his Holineſſe, who in his predeceſſours time, admitted all into the degree of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctourſhip, who ſhould be iudged worthy thereof, by ſuch as were in office for that purpoſe in that Vniuerſitie, aſwell as in all others: and the moſt iniurious <hi>Breue,</hi> which afterwardes the Ieſuites procured againſt all Engliſhmen, aſwell Diuines, as Lawyers, was not as yet procured by them. But this fellow his griefe is, that he, or any other ſhould take degrees, vnleſſe they would become of their faction, which maketh them to haue ſo many venerable Doctours for them, and ſo forward, as ſome of them haue not bluſhed to take vpon them to heare and determine the matters of ſuch learned men, as were iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt worthy of that degree, and had it, and other honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places in Gods Church, when theſe were blockheaded boyes: and cannot but mooue wonder and alſo laughter to thoſe who knewe them, to thinke <hi>in what corner,</hi> or how they came to be made Doctours. But they were the fitteſt ſubiects for Ieſuites to worke vppon, and ſtood moſt in neede of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie commendations from ſuch Superiours, as here this Authour would that <hi>M.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſeuenth Chapter of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intendeth to ſhewe the generall troubles and diſquietneſſe, which were raiſed among the Engliſh Catholikes in Flaunders and England, during the former ſtirres in Rome and <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and how the one gaue hand vnto the other, &amp; that all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from different members of the ſelfe ſame faction. And this his narration of the Flemiſh troubles, he beginneth at the yere of our Lord 1588. and continueth it with many idle diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and altogether impertinent to the preſent controuerſie. But when he hath told his tale of thoſe matters, then he patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereunto the ſtirres in England, with an <hi>As in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie against F.</hi> Holt, <hi>&amp; others in Flanders, theſe few had againſt them all the body of our Cath. nation, &amp;c. So fareth it now in England, where a very few at the beginning, partly vpon ſtomacke and auerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather diſcontentment, partly of ambition, vnquietnes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and deſire of contention (as by their doings may appeare) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to oppoſe themſelues againſt the whole streame of other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, deuiſing particular wayes for their owne preferment.</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable mildneſſe of this <hi>Apologie-maker,</hi> and his true religious pietie! But it is great pitie to interrupt him, for he meaneth to ſhewe his reader the true ſtate of the queſtion; and thus hee proceedeth, <hi>And ſince that time haue drawen in diuers other, one vpon one motiue, another vpon another, ſome for preferrement, ſome for diſcontentment, ſome for other occaſions, to take their parts: and being once engaged, to leape with them from an inch to an ell, &amp; from a little ſlide to a headlong precipitation.</hi> A godly proceſſion, but where is the true ſtate of the queſtion? Forſooth, <hi>and this is the true state of the question.</hi> Happie is he who can vnderſtand it: A <hi>few diſcontented,</hi> vpon ſuch cauſes as this author affirmeth, <hi>began to oppoſe themſelues against the whole ſtreame of other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> but you muſt goe looke wherein: and thoſe fewe made ſome other <hi>to leape from an inch to an ell:</hi> and this is the <hi>true ſtate
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5209:85"/> of the queſtion.</hi> How haue we hitherto bene deceiued, in taking the <hi>true ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> to be in matters principally <hi>between the Secular Prieſts, and the Ieſuits,</hi> as ſometime we are told in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> namely in the firſt Chapter fol. 2. or <hi>betweene the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests, and their Archprieſt principally:</hi> as other ſometime we are tolde in the ſame <hi>Apologie, cap. 11. fol. 161?</hi> Now we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the <hi>true ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> is <hi>betweene ſome fewe, and the whole ſtreame of other Catholikes:</hi> But what skilleth it, ſince that euery thing is vſed in his place to ſome good purpoſe, for the bringing about that, which is principally intended by the authors of the <hi>Apologie?</hi> The oppoſition then <hi>againſt the whole ſtreame of Catholikes,</hi> and particular deuiſes for preferment, with the making diuers other <hi>to leape</hi> or <hi>ſlide,</hi> muſt here be ſuggeſted to be <hi>the true ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> which how deeply it may touch the Ieſuits and their factious adherents, is, or will be declared elſewhere; to wit, with what ambition they ſought their owne preferment in the caſtle of <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and with what ſcandall they wrought it, by a moſt wicked <hi>ſeparation</hi> or <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> at what time <hi>the true ſtate of the queſtion</hi> was: whether the Ieſuites and their fellow-factious committed any ſinne, or did like Chriſtians, in making that diuiſion in <hi>Wisbich</hi> from their fellow priſoners, and prieſts as they were, ſuffering all vnder that name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and Catholike prieſts. Secondly, with what ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnquietneſſe of ſpirit, and deſire of contention, the Ieſuites began to oppoſe themſelues againſt other Catholike prieſts, when they writ that wicked and ſenſleſſe libell of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no name of diſgrace which a Ieſuits malice could deuiſe, at what time <hi>the true state of the queſtion</hi> was: whether the prieſts were bound to ſubiect themſelues to an authoritie procured by falſhood (as the letters of inſtitution ſhewed) propoſed with falſhood, as then the Archprieſt, being taken in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, could not deny, put in execution contrary to the tenour thereof, hauing no letters from his Holineſſe; beſides whom, the Prieſtes had no knowen <hi>Superiour,</hi> either for the erection of that authoritie, nor any teſtimonie, that any other had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer giuen vnto them by him to make that ſubordination. Thirdly, with what ſtomacke, and auerſion from all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peace the Ieſuites proclaimed (after that the peace was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5209:86"/> made) that <hi>they all incurred the cenſures of holy Church, who ſhould</hi> dogmatizando, <hi>mainteine, that thoſe Prieſts were not</hi> ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, <hi>who forbore to ſubiect themſelues vnto the auctoritie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw his Holines letters in confirmation thereof, and the Archprieſt publiſhed, that <hi>he had receiued a reſolution from the mother City:</hi> which afterwards hee explicated himſelfe to ſome, that it was from a paire of yong Ieſuits: to wit, <hi>F. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> &amp; <hi>F. Tichborne,</hi> or from one of them. The contents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were, that theſe prieſts were <hi>ſchſmaticks,</hi> which is now <hi>the true ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> (as none but moſt impudent compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can deny) and the original of theſe preſent ſtirres. And this the Archprieſt his fact, the author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> in the 11. chap <hi>fol. 168.</hi> calleth <hi>an angry Epiſtle,</hi> and challengeth the prieſts in termes beſt fitting his Religious humor, that for <hi>an angry E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> they would breake out into ſuch ſcandalous tumults, and ſo leaueth the matter without telling, what this <hi>angry Epiſtle</hi> was, and that it was a proclamation, that the Prieſts had liued a long time <hi>inſchiſme:</hi> and what other matters muſt thereupon neceſſarily inſue, not onely to the diſcredit of thoſe prieſts, but alſo to the diſturbance of many deuout Catholicks, whoſe ghoſtly fathers they had bene, during that time. But ſince that this author hath propoſed <hi>the true ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as he ſaith, to be <hi>an oppoſition of a few againſt the whole ſtreame of other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, deuiſing particuler wayes for their preferring, and there cauſing ſome to leape, and ſlide:</hi> Let vs do him the fauor to heare how he proceedeth with this his imagination. <hi>And this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the true ſtate of the queſtion: let vs declare briefly the way, and path how they came into this pit.</hi> Thus he beginneth this declaration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee haue vnderſtood by Card. Allens letters before mentioned, written to</hi> M. Muſh <hi>the yeere that he died, how he had vnderſtood of a certaine emulation, and deuiſion begun in England by ſome prieſts againſt the</hi> Fa. <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>and perhaps hee perceiued the ſame by no meanes more, then by himſelfe, his ſpeach and behauiour, while hee was at Rome with him the very ſame yeere.</hi> I doe nothing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile that this good fellow, would faine haue his Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the Prieſts began a diuiſion againſt the Ieſuits. For if he could perſwade this, he would not doubt, but to deale well ynough with ſuch fooles, as cannot thinke, that the Ieſuits can
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5209:86"/> giue any iuſt cauſe, why the Prieſts ſhould breake with them. I marueile much, that he is not aſhamed ſo often to inculcate this letter of the Cardinall; which if it make any thing in this matter, it maketh againſt the Ieſuits, as we haue often ſhewed. For firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the diuiſion, the <hi>Fathers</hi> want of good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence is firſt placed, the cauſe of diſcontentment not knowen, and <hi>M. Muſh</hi> a Secular Prieſt put in commiſſion to be <hi>peremptory, aſwell with the Ieſuits as the Secular Prieſts,</hi> with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cardinall knew he might be bold, eſpecially in ſo good an action, as was the furthering of a peace, where he was informed there was want. And for the better ſatisfaction of ſuch as will be ſatisfied, we will once againe repeate the Card. letter, as it is ſet downe in the ſecond Chap. of <hi>Apologie fol 11. I haue heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to my great griefe, that there is not that good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betweene the Fathers, &amp; other Prieſts. I cannot tell vpon what diſcontentment, &amp;c. But whereof ſoeuer it commeth, it is of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and with all poſsible diſcretion, and diligence, by the wiſer ſort on both ſides to be rooted out, or els it will be the ruine of the whole cauſe, &amp;c. And therefore in this point eſpecially</hi> (M. Muſh) <hi>be earneſt, and peremptory with all parties, and euery one in particular, and tel them that I charge, and aduiſe them by the bleſſed Blood, and bowels of Gods mercie, that they honour, loue, and eſteeme one another, according to euery mans age, order, and profeſsion.</hi> And then he exhorteth thoſe of the Secular order, which is an argument, that what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did principally concerne the Ieſuits. The maner alſo of the Cardinall his writing doeth ſhew, that what he conceiued of the diuiſion here ſuppoſed, was by other meanes then by <hi>M. Muſh:</hi> For had he vnderſtood it (as this Author ſaith) <hi>perhaps by no meanes more, then by himſelfe, his ſpeech, and behauiour, while he was in Rome,</hi> without <hi>perhaps</hi> the Cardinall would not haue written vnto him, after his departure in this maner: <hi>I haue heard to my great griefe, that there is not that good correſpondence between the</hi> Fathers <hi>and other Priests, I cannot tell vpon what diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but rather haue put him in minde, what he had tolde him, and would not haue bene left ignorant of the true cauſe, or ſome colour of cauſe, if <hi>M. Muſh</hi> had diſcouered any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto him: And whereas here is mention of <hi>M. Muſh</hi> his behauiour while he was in Rome with the Cardinall, we may
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5209:87"/> verely beleeue, that it was ſuch, as became an honeſt prieſt, and that he gaue very great ſatisfaction, not onely to the Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> but alſo to many other, hauing thoſe graces, and fauours at his returne, which no man euer had before him: to wit, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, not onely for himſelfe in diuers reſerued caſes,</hi> but to giue to a certaine number of other prieſts, whom he would name at his returne into England. But marke, I pray you, what moueth this author to ſay; that the Cardinal writ his letter vpon <hi>M. Muſh</hi> his behauiour, when he was with him at Rome the very ſame yeere. <hi>For albeit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this man gaue out euery where, that he went to Rome, to enter into that order, which many yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had pretended: yet others that knew him better, did ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his alienation from them, and that he pretended perhaps by his iourney to Rome, to get ſome other dignitie.</hi> Here there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Perhaps</hi> to helpe the former. For firſt it was <hi>perhaps</hi> that the Cardinall <hi>perceiued a certaine diuiſion, by no meanes more then by</hi> M. Muſh <hi>his behauiour and ſpeech at Rome:</hi> and now it is <hi>perhaps that he went to Rome, for to get ſome other dignitie.</hi> Good meditations for ſuch ſpirituall guides, and very charitable. We will not here cite <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> his letter, which was written in the yeere of our Lord 1596, which was two yeres after the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals death: wherein hee taketh on marueilouſly againſt all thoſe, who did affirme at Rome, that there had bene <hi>ſtrife,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>falling out</hi> here in England, which was worth the talking of: although neither he, nor any man els can denie, but that the ſcandalous ſeparation in <hi>Wisbich</hi> was begun by the Ieſuits and their faction, long before, and is not to this day ended. We wil onely requeſt the religious ſpirit of the author of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> to let vs vnderſtand what reaſon he had in this place, to make this note in the margent, <hi>How this last ſedition in England began,</hi> ſhewing nothing in the text, but his general conceit of an <hi>emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and diuiſion begun in England, by ſome Prieſts against the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>of the</hi> Societie: and bringeth no other proofe therof, then the Card <hi>Allen</hi> his letter aboue mentioned, wherein there is no more mention of any diuiſion by Secular prieſts againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, then by the Ieſuits againſt Secular prieſts, as hath bene ſhewed. And if by this note we are giuen to vnderſtand, How that this laſt ſedition in England began before this letter of the Car. <hi>Allen</hi> was written: then at the lateſt this laſt ſedition muſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5209:87"/> haue his beginning in the yere of our Lord <hi>1594</hi> or before For in that yeere the Cardinal died, as it is here confeſſed in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. fol. 6.</hi> Now then if this laſt ſedition in England did begin in the yeere of our Lord <hi>1594,</hi> or before, what was the ſecret intention which this Religious ſpirit had, when in the 9. Chap. of this <hi>Apologie fol. 131.</hi> it made this marginal note, <hi>The first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of the ſedition</hi> M. Collington, <hi>and</hi> M. Charnocke <hi>by his owne confeſsion;</hi> how could theſe men be the beginners of this ſedition by an acte done in the yeere of our Lord <hi>1598</hi> at the ſooneſt (for ſo the letter conſtitutiue beareth date, about which this confeſſion is ſaid to haue bene made) when this author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that <hi>this laſt ſedition was begun in the time of Card. Allen,</hi> who died in the yeere of our Lord 1594. But as the good-wife of an Ordinary ſaith, <hi>A ioynt is a ioynt,</hi> ſo with this good fellow, <hi>A booke is a booke</hi> And it is no great matter how one piece is pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to another: the fooles who are deuoted vnto him wil take al with <hi>blinde obedience:</hi> and for the reſt there wil be ſome other deuiſe: as to ſtand ſtoutly to the auerring of any thing, which may further his cauſe, or the denying whatſoeuer may hinder it.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus farre preſumed vpon the ſimplicity of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he proceedeth in his declaration of the way or path, or the ſuppoſed <hi>true ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> and continueth his tale of <hi>M. Muſh</hi> his negotiation. <hi>But returning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into England, as he went foorth, and the Cardinall ſoone after dying, he ioyned with an other of his owne humour, that had left another religion, namely the</hi> Carthuſians (and in the margent he ſetteth M <hi>Iohn Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) <hi>and they two with ſome few other, determined to make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine newe Hierarchie of their owne, calling it an</hi> aſſociation <hi>of Clergie men with two</hi> Superiours, <hi>as it were Archbiſhops, the one for the South, and the other for the North, with certaine</hi> Rules <hi>and deuiſes impoſsible to be obſerued in England, while times and matters doe remaine as they doe, &amp;c.</hi> It is very well knowen that M. <hi>Muſh</hi> returning into England, imployed himſelfe in more offices of charitie, then all the Ieſuites in England. And all the North parts of England will affirme it: eſpecially thoſe who were in durance for their conſcience. And when the ſpirit of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits mooued them, vnder pretence of reformation in <hi>Wisbich</hi> to make their ſcandalous ſeparation and <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompanied with M. <hi>Dudlie,</hi> where after that they had
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:5209:88"/> ſpent ſome dayes, and perceiued that there was no hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accord, but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of him, who was Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>F. Weſton,</hi> who canuaſed in <hi>Wisbich</hi> for a ſuperioritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of an <hi>Agent,</hi> he came to London, where he found this <hi>Superiour,</hi> and after long conference with him about it, as one, who was loath the matter beganne ſhould go backward, he promiſed at the length to ſend ſuch letters vnto <hi>Wisbich</hi> by them, that at the ſight thereof his ſubiect <hi>Fa. Weſton</hi> ſhould ſurceaſe from that intended <hi>Agencie,</hi> and all ſhould bee well. But M. <hi>Muſh</hi> and M. <hi>Dudlie</hi> were compelled to ſend for theſe letters, and if they had not vrged the matter in ſuch ſort as this <hi>Superiour</hi> could not any longer halt with them, they had departed with ſuch letters, as had bene to no purpoſe, and the time was differred vntill it was ſo late, as he hoped they would not haue ſtayed for any other.</p>
               <p>The peace being in the ende made, ſuch as it was, and not without this vnder-hand condition, that the Ieſuits &amp; their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might afterward breake off, when they would, <hi>M. Muſh,</hi> and <hi>M. Dudley</hi> at their next returne to <hi>London,</hi> if not before, delt with <hi>M.

Colington</hi> (not being neere Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don) knew nothing of this intent: &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it hath pleaſed this author now to except againſt it, there will be good proofe made, that the <hi>Superior</hi> of the Ieſuits was ſo farre from ſpeaking againſt it, as he did ſeeme to take great ioy in it, vntill he perceiued, that he was not likely to haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment thereof, as his fellow had in <hi>Wisbich</hi> of the greater part of the Catholike priſoners: And if the <hi>vnited prieſts</hi> were the authors of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> how ridiculouſly are ſixe of them brought in here to credit it, as though there were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie in theſe 6. alone, taken ſingly from the reſt, then 16. in the whole company of thoſe <hi>vnited brethren,</hi> when thoſe ſixe alſo are among them, but it ſhalbe well ſeene in a particular anſwer to their letter, here cited, that whoſoeuer were the authors thereof, thoſe ſixe, who ſubſcribed vnto it, had ſmal cauſe to doe ſo, or to thanke them, who eaſed them of the labour to pen it.</p>

               <p>But now remitting the reader for <hi>M. Collington</hi> his iuſt cauſes of <hi>leauing the order of the</hi> Carthuſians (in which he neuer was, but onely in probation, which argued a moſt religious minde in him, and was croſſed onely by the diſablements of his body) to the laſt point handled by himſelfe in his late booke of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons intituled <hi>A iuſt defence &amp;c.</hi> And for <hi>M. Muſh</hi> his leauing the Ieſuits, to the eleuenth Chapter of the <hi>Apologie, fol. 170,</hi> where it is plainely ſaid, that <hi>they would not admit him,</hi> we will ſee how this <hi>Apologie</hi> fitteth his Reader.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by this narration in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> it is euident, that the <hi>aſſociation,</hi> of which here is mention, was not deuiſed by ſuch as thought <hi>their deſignements fruſtrated by</hi> Fa. Parſons <hi>dealing at Rome in the yeere 1597,</hi> as the author of this ſame <hi>Apologie</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>cap. 1 fol. 6. &amp; 7.</hi> Secondly, it is vntrue, that <hi>theſe two</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined vpon any ſuch matter. Thirdly, there was neuer any determination to haue <hi>two Superiors,</hi> much leſſe, <hi>as it were Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops:</hi> For as may appeare by the <hi>rules</hi> made in the <hi>North,</hi> the very firſt <hi>rule, De rectoribus,</hi> is this: <hi>There ſhall be choſen euery yere one</hi> Father, <hi>and two</hi> aſſiſtants, <hi>by the conſents and moſt voices of the brethren.</hi> And vnder another title afterward there is this <hi>rule: When in any Countrey the multitude of the brethren are increaſed to the number of eight, and cannot conueniently reſort to the conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this confraternitie in the Countrey where the</hi> Father <hi>and the</hi> Aſſiſtants <hi>abide, they ſhall at their owne diſcretions chuſe a father, &amp;c.</hi> But neither in the <hi>rules</hi> made in the <hi>South</hi> is mention of any more then one <hi>Superior.</hi> And theſe diuers <hi>rules</hi> were made, not that one form ſhould be of force in the <hi>North,</hi> &amp; another in the <hi>South,</hi> but that one forme ſhould be drawen for al England out of ſuch <hi>rules,</hi> as were thoght fit by the prieſts, which liued either in the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>North parts</hi> of England. And the forme which was drawen in the <hi>South,</hi> was accepted by thoſe in the <hi>North</hi> with ſome few <hi>rules</hi> added, or altered. And this was ſo well knowen abroad, and confirmed alſo by that, the two prieſts ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no other forme with them to Rome, as I cannot marueile enough at the author of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> that he will cite the rules which were made in the <hi>North,</hi> yea and take his arguments (although fooliſh) from them againſt the prieſts, as here hee doth <hi>fol 91.</hi> where firſt he argueth out of them negatiuely, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5209:89"/> there was no <hi>mention made at all in their constitutions, that the ſame ſhould be confirmed by his Holineſſe:</hi> as though the author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> did not know that <hi>Fiſher</hi> vnder his oath at Rome had affirmed, that the prieſts determined to ſend ſome to his Holineſſe for this purpoſe, and named the perſons: and if this teſtimony were not, many are yet liuing, who made their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Holineſſe vnder their owne handes for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof. And theſe petitions were taken from M <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> among other their writings, when they were apprehended at Rome by the Ieſuites. The ſecond aduantage which this Authour would ſcrape out of thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> of the North is: that <hi>they left no appeale to Rome, or other place:</hi> and this he would prooue out of their Chapter (as he ſayth) of <hi>Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and then he ſetteth downe almoſt all the Chapter in this manner, <hi>That no appeale ſhall be made from the ſentence of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to them of an other Countrey: but all the brethren ſhall content themſelues with the iudgement of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>and</hi> aſſiſtants, <hi>or more part of the company, where he ſhalbe, &amp;c.</hi> Thus farre in the <hi>Apologie.</hi> Whereby he would proue that the prieſts would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre appeale to Rome. Can any man thinke his wits were at home? is there any mention of any, but of the ſeuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vnder diuerſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Superiours</hi> here in England? and how doth he drawe it to a debarring appeale to Rome? But marke I pray you this fellowes falſhood: to helpe himſelfe to make this fooliſh calumniatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he hath cited the <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>decree,</hi> as he calleth it: but he cited it with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould vnderſtand, that ſomewhat did follow, although he ſaid not what. And in that he would haue his Reader knowe thus much; it is likely he knew it himſelfe, and what it was: and moreouer that if he had ſet it downe, he had diſcouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue bene a notorious calumniator. And the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cannot but note him, for a very falſe fellow in his dealings. The rule beginneth in this manner: <hi>No appeale,</hi> and ſo foorth as he ſet it downe vnto theſe wordes: <hi>where he ſhalbe,</hi> and then it goeth on thus: <hi>for the preſent, vnleſſe it ſeeme otherwiſe more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, by the moſt voyces of the company.</hi> So that there is appeale left from thoſe of one company to them of an other countrey, if it be thought conuenient by the moſt of them. And whereas
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5209:89"/> he would hereupon inferre an abſurditie againſt the Prieſts, like to that, which the Archprieſt committed, when he would not admit appeale to Rome, he committeth as great folly, as in any of the other. For the Archprieſt ſtood peremptorily in it in plaine termes, that we could not appeale from him to Rome, and this rule was onely for ſuch, as would in ſuch maner vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſubiect themſelues to their ſuperiors. And as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the rule, there was no mention of Rome. But put the caſe that the prieſts had debarred themſelues of appealing to Rome, is it all one thing in this Authors conceit, for a man to be content, to part willingly with that which he hath, and to haue it vniuſtly taken away from him? If the prieſts had made ſuch a <hi>Rule,</hi> as that they would haue debarred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereof, was this any warrant for the Archprieſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude ſuch a matter vpon them againſt their wils, hauing no ſuch commiſſion from any that could giue it vnto him, which is alſo to be vnderſtood in friuolous matters? But the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt play at ſmall game, or els he muſt ſit ſtill.</p>
               <p>That calumniation alſo is hereby anſwered, which is layd to <hi>D. Bagſhaw,</hi> that he thought it not fit for them, to be tied to <hi>Rules</hi> at <hi>Wisbich:</hi> For the difference is manifeſt: for that the <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was free for all who would, and who would not might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as they did, without any impeachment, either of ſame, or what els ſoeuer: thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> at <hi>Wisbich</hi> were to be accepted of all ſo neceſſarily, as the not accepting thereof was deemed by the reſt a ſufficient cauſe, to make that <hi>ſcandalous ſchiſme,</hi> which was there made, and remaineth as yet, and to defame all thoſe who would not ſubiect themſelues to the Ieſuits who were the deuiſors, and muſt be ſuperiors alſo, vnder the title of <hi>Agents.</hi>

                  <hi>Touching the deteſtable</hi> Memoriall <hi>here mentioned</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>drawen out, and publiſhed, &amp;c.</hi> Here is nothing to be ſaid of this <hi>Memoriall,</hi> more then that the Ieſuits were the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers thereof in England, (ſo far as we can learne) and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it into Engliſh, for women to ſee it, and vnderſtand it. The <hi>contempt of Vniuerſitie men, and graduats,</hi> of which the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its are ſaid to be accuſed in the <hi>Memoriall,</hi> is not obſcurely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in this <hi>Apologie, cap 6 fol. 76.</hi> where ſpeaking of M.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5209:90"/> for his Doctorſhip:</hi> being a Doctor of Diuinitie, and proceeding in <hi>Padua</hi> with the applauſe of the Vniuerſitie. And in this 7. <hi>Chap fol. 93.</hi> he putteth this limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Ieſuits their eſteem of <hi>Vniuerſitte men and graduats; If their vertue anſwere to their degrees:</hi> that is, to ſpeake the true Engliſh, if they will bee wrought to be Ieſuits, or factious for them. And whereas it is ſaid, that Ieſuits are more hurtfull to Catholikes then heretiks, let indifferent men giue their verdit, after due conſiderations of the diuiſions made by them. And as for this author his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie, that theſe articles of the <hi>Memoriall</hi> came from D. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> (whom he here inſinuateth to haue bene <hi>expelled the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Rome for his troubleſome ſpirit,</hi> with a reference to Card. <hi>Sega</hi> his viſitation, which is well knowen to haue bene long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Doctor his departure from Rome) his perſwaſion is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very weake ground. For although ſuch articles might be giuen or ſent to M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> vnder his hand, to carie to Rome: yet theſe articles might come from ſome other, the <hi>Memoriall</hi> being long before made, and at Rome, as appeareth in this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, fol. 94.</hi> where alſo Do. <hi>Barret</hi> affirmeth, that he found a little compendious note of all their articles againſt the Ieſuits at Rome, <hi>which</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>hee</hi> (Fiſher) <hi>carried with him to dilate to the faction in England:</hi> and for proofe hereof he addeth: <hi>as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; for it is very old, and almoſt worne out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the fooliſh ſtory of <hi>Fiſher,</hi> we here leaue out, as not worth the noting, he hauing bene in the iudgement of this author, fol. 93. <hi>one of the moſt exorbitant diſorderly fellowes in the Romane ſtirs.</hi> And fol. 95. <hi>albeit</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>wee will not affirme all to be true which he ſaid: yet many things are ſuch, as they could not be well feigned, and are confirmed otherwiſe: and the ſpeaking voluntarily vpon his oath muſt be preſumed, to haue had ſome care alſo of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp;c.</hi> or of his ſides, as himſelfe confeſſed at Paris. But I pray you let there be <hi>care of conſcience</hi> at the leſt with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch matters as may make for the Ieſuits. Some things heere ſet downe are not onely falſe, but ſo impertinent to the matter, as we cannot but iudge, that there was much good iugling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him, &amp; his examiner: as that which is affirmed, fol. 96. <hi>At London I lay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly with M.</hi> Charnock, <hi>otherwiſe called</hi> Long, <hi>and M.</hi> Medcalfe: whereas the poore man was neuer in any
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5209:90"/> ſuch credit with either of them, as that hee was acquainted where either of them lay: yet ſome things at the leaſt <hi>could not be well feigned:</hi> perchance that <hi>beeing bidden to a banquet at</hi> Wisbich <hi>he had a ſwanne,</hi> which was the more to be noted, becauſe it was a very vnuſual diſh at a <hi>banquet,</hi> vnleſſe we turne the <hi>banquet</hi> into a dinner, and then the grace of this relation is marred. For the reader muſt conceiue that the prieſts in <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich</hi> did not <hi>dine,</hi> (that is, too groſſe) but they did <hi>banquet:</hi> and he muſt vnderſtand, that <hi>the Priests had a Swan,</hi> at that <hi>banquet.</hi> Certainely either <hi>Fiſher</hi> did herein ſhewe himſelfe to be too weake a man to be brought here for an authenticall witneſſe, vnleſſe ſome ſuch particular queſtion as this is, was demanded of him, <hi>What good cheere had you?</hi> or elſe the examiner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fooliſh, who in a ſerious matter would fall into ſuch queſtions, and ſet downe ſuch ſtuffe in an examination. But had not ſuch folly beene to be vttered, we ſhould haue had no <hi>Apologie.</hi> One thing more is here to be noted, that fol. 96. this author relateth out of <hi>Fiſhers</hi> examination, that <hi>there paſſed eight or nine moneths in diuerſitie of opinions:</hi> and that he <hi>went ſeuen or eight times from the</hi> North <hi>parts to</hi> Wisbich, Cambridge, <hi>and</hi> London, <hi>about an affaire which would not well ſtand with the</hi> aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation <hi>then begun.</hi> Which being compared with that which is alſo affirmed fol. 97. where it is ſaid, that it was not knowen <hi>at his departure from England, that peace was made at Rome, or that Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>was come thither: albeit M.</hi> Bagſhaw <hi>and his friends ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to feare it much:</hi> This author muſt wipe his mouth, for his falſe tale told in the firſt Chapter, fol. 6. and 7. where hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that <hi>the reliques of thoſe that had beene</hi> troubleſome, <hi>and vnquiet before, comming into England, and conferring againe with their conſorts, of their former actions and deſignments, fruſtrated (as they thought) by Fa.</hi> Parſons <hi>dealing at Rome, reſolued to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but after another faſhion: to wit, by deuiſing a certaine</hi> newe aſſociation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did theſe men (who were thus <hi>fruſtrated at Rome by F.</hi> Parſons <hi>his dealing there</hi>) know that Fa. <hi>Parſons was come to Rome,</hi> trow yee? If they did know thereof, and were in England before <hi>Fiſhers</hi> departure from England, how was it <hi>vnknowen there at his departure thence, that F.</hi> Parſons <hi>was come to Rome?</hi> If they knew thereof, but were not as yet come into England, before <hi>Fiſhers</hi> departure from thence, how did <hi>Fiſher</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:5209:91"/> goe <hi>ſeuen or eight times from the</hi> North <hi>parts to</hi> Wisbich, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, <hi>and</hi> London, about the affaire he ſpeaketh of, in which the <hi>aſſociation</hi> had cauſed diuerſitie of opinions? For if this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour be an honeſt man, thoſe men, who were ſaid in his firſt Chapter fol. 6. and 7. to haue bene <hi>fruſtrated (as they thought) by F.</hi> Parſons <hi>dealing in Rome, reſolued to begin againe by deuiſing a certaine new</hi> aſſociation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But perchance <hi>Fiſher</hi> dreamed, that hee was employed in ſuch buſineſſe in England, and how that he had <hi>a ſwan at a banquet in</hi> Wisbich, <hi>and lay at</hi> London <hi>with M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>and M.</hi> Heburne, and much other good newes. And this authour putteth downe his dreame, as an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall teſtimonie, for want of other ſtuffe. And if hee had not dreamed himſelfe, when hee ſet it downe, doubtleſſe hee would haue omitted ſo much at the leaſt, as (if one dreamer may conuince another of falſhood) conuinceth him moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly of fault in his relation of the <hi>beginning of the aſſociation,</hi> ſet downe in his <hi>firſt</hi> chapter, as we haue noted. <hi>But by this</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apologie</hi>) <hi>any indifferent man may ſee, how matters ſtand, and where the ground of all troubles and diſsenſions lyeth. All is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie of euill humors, againſt them that doe better then themſelues, and euery man that loueth his ſoule will ſoone deſcrie the ſame. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not ſought by this faction, but reuenge and ſatisfaction of bad appetites.</hi> This wrote he, who knew well what he ſaid, although his vngratiouſneſſe would haue his reader apply it to others, and not to him, who deſerued it, as hath bene ſhewed: and will ſtill appeare in euery chapter more clearely then other. And in this vaine he telleth his reader, that his Holines <hi>cleerely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, tooke order firſt in the Romane colledge</hi> (which belongeth to another place) <hi>and then in England for remedie thereof, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhall heare.</hi> And ſo he ſetteth himſelfe to the eight chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where at the very firſt he doth notably abuſe his reader, as ſhall be ſhewed, and he conuinced of moſt manifeſt falſhood, and to be a chiefe man in the conſpiracie of euill humours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch men as ſought religion with the greateſt hazard of their liues, when he and his fellowes were idle lookers on, and would be no actors, vntil room was made for their fatherhoods.</p>

               <p>But now to the maine <hi>motiue</hi> of this <hi>Subordination,</hi> and that which cauſed his Holines <hi>to conſult for ſome moneths, and to ſeeke for informations out of England (of the</hi> quiet <hi>at the leaſt) for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt men for gouernment,</hi> (as this author immediatly ſuggeſteth) we muſt conceiue ſome ſuch ſtrange miracle; as that there was ſome extraordinary day, weeke, or moneth, in which this <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> was made, <hi>conſultation</hi> had, and <hi>information</hi> giuen. In this chapter <hi>fol. 102.</hi> it is confeſſed: and if it were not, it would bee otherwiſe prooued, that the Cardinals letters, by which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was inſtituted, did beare date the ſeuenth of <hi>March,</hi> in the yeere 1598. This then being diſpatched at that time, what time would a reaſonable man haue allowed for the trauailing of the <hi>motiues</hi> thereof out of England to Rome? How many wil he geſſe thoſe moneths to be which are here ſaid by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that his Hol. tooke to <hi>conſult, and to haue intelligence from the</hi> quiet <hi>in England, of the fitteſt men for gouernment,</hi> and could

               <p>And whereas the Romanes had gotten the ſtart of vs in England for ſome tenne dayes in the courſe of the yeere, now the Engliſh had gotten the ſtart of them, and made their <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> come many moneths after ours.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5209:94"/> inſtituted by the Cardinall: the <hi>Protectors meaning</hi> not being knowen otherwiſe, then by his proceedings in the inſtitution of this auctority, did miniſter cauſe of ſuſpition, that he knew not what he did. The meaning of the <hi>informers,</hi> for procuring this authoritie (being not knowen to be any other men, then Ieſuits, &amp; confeſſed to be thoſe <hi>fol. 99.</hi> by this author, to wit, <hi>Fa.

For when the prieſts determined vpon the erecting of their <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> they had the petitions to his Holines of many aſwell of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt prieſts, as other: ſome in general termes for ſome <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,</hi> ſome to haue his allowance for their ioyning parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in that maner, as they wiſhed, vnder a head, and ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> as were propoſed: and ſome of theſe were written before this <hi>Subordination</hi> was made, as is confeſſed in the 5. article of the <hi>Libel,</hi> which was put vp at Rome to the Cardinall <hi>Caietan,</hi> and <hi>Burgheſius</hi> vpon the <hi>17.</hi> of <hi>February 1599.</hi> in the Engliſh Colledge, which alſo demonſtrateth, how falſe the imputation is <hi>fol 100,</hi> that without all <hi>Superiors</hi> auctoritie, they (the prieſts) would haue ſet vp their <hi>Aſſociation.</hi>

               <p>But marke, I pray you, how this felow goeth onwards in this narration, and you ſhal quickly find where his ſhooe did wring him. <hi>For ſo long</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as our Clergie proceeded in the Spirit of humilitie, obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, peace, &amp; vnitie, there was no need of</hi> Superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for that euery one was a rule, and law to himſelfe.</hi> Where was this defect of <hi>humilitie, obedience, peace, &amp; vnitie?</hi> or in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:5209:95"/> for ſuperioritie be an argument of pride, then was this defect in the Ieſuits and not in the prieſts. For as all the world knoweth, the Ieſuits ſought a Superioritie in <hi>Wisbich</hi> ouer the Secular prieſts. Or if they wil ſtoutly ſtand vpon it, that it was thruſt vpon them: yet they muſt confeſſe, that it was moſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſuch as were ſecretly Ieſuits, as <hi>F. Bickley, F. Bolton, F. Archer,</hi> and who els. And that when it grew to a marueilous tempeſt, the Ieſuits perſiſted ſtill in their courſe, or canuas for the ſuperiority, vnder the title of an <hi>Agencie;</hi> neither was there any diſobedience euer noted in any of the prieſts, but to <hi>F. We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> the Ieſuit, and firſt vſurper in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> which was not to be called a diſobedience, but a reſiſting rather of his ambitious humor, and his fellowes: who laboured, notwithſtanding the ſcandal which came thereof, to make him <hi>Superior</hi> ouer the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſts liuing then in the <hi>Caſtle:</hi> by which, peace was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a moſt ſinfull diuiſion begun, ſo farre foorth, as thoſe factious innouators would not eate with thoſe prieſts, who would not ſubiect themſelues vnto the Ieſuit. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>creſcente numero diſcipulorum, factum est murmur</hi> Graeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum <hi>aduerſus</hi> Hebraeos, <hi>&amp;c. when the multitude of our priests en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the former ſpirit in many of them decreaſed, then begun preſently murmuration, and</hi> emulation <hi>againſt the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>as though they onely did hinder vs, who indeed were, and are the men, that doe principally helpe vs both in word, &amp; life; ſo long as we were content to learne.</hi> Hinc illae lacrymae, We would not be contented to learne any longer of the Ieſuits. If this fellow had ment honeſtly, he would haue cited a litle more of the text of Scripture. But then perchance it would haue made againſt him more, then he would his ſimple Reader ſhould vnderſtand. He taketh as much as he liſteth to apply, &amp; leaueth out the reſt: yet doeth he falſly apply alſo that which he bringeth. For in our caſe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> for they came firſt into this harueſt: and the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> muſt be theſe murmuring <hi>Graecians,</hi> who came in after vs: and the Ieſuits not being contented with their fellowlike State with the prieſts, muſt become forſooth, M. <hi>Agents,</hi> and take charge of the prieſts, whether they wil or no; as in their vproare at <hi>Wisbich</hi> was manifeſt to all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But now to that which this authour concealed vnder an
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:5209:95"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the text it followeth, <hi>eo quò deſpicerentur in miniſterio quotidiano viduae eorum: becauſe their widowes were deſpiſed, or contemned in the daily ſeruice, which vſed to be performed by wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in thoſe times.</hi> And by this it would haue bene apparant, that the pride of the Ieſuits had bene the cauſe of this <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and our <hi>peace broken</hi> vpon their fooliſh ſelfe conceite, that they were not <hi>ſicut caeteri homines, as other men.</hi> But note I pray you, how the text is turned, from a <hi>deſpiſing</hi> or <hi>contemning,</hi> to a conceite, that the prieſts <hi>were hindered by the Ieſuites.</hi> It is alſo further to be obſerued, that when the multitude of <hi>Prieſts</hi> were great, and the number of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> very ſmall, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> conferred together, and great peace was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. But when the number of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> encreaſed, that they began to conceiue a hope of Superioritie, &amp; to bring the Secular prieſts into a ſlauiſh bondage vnder them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take exceptions againſt the prieſts, and the more wicked and ſinfull the ſlanderer was, the more vnited he was to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites. And no other remedie muſt be vſed, but a <hi>Subordination</hi> to a Ieſuit, to keepe the prieſts in order. And this was thought fit, to be firſt attempted at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> where the prieſts liuing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the almes, which Catholikes ſent thither, might be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therunto by the Catholikes there, withdrawing their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from them: to which purpoſe the Ieſuites friends imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues abroad. <hi>But ſome comming out of the Seminaries</hi> (ſaith this Authour) <hi>where they had liued vnder the Ieſuites, with leſſe, or worſe Spirit, then were to be wiſhed, drew other to emulate them, whom before they had obeyed.</hi> This <hi>emulation</hi> would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: The Prieſts affirme, that the Ieſuites pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the cauſe of all the ſtirre in England, and for proofe they bring their attempt at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> before which time all was in quiet. And as ſome prieſts did ſometimes obey ſome Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, as Rectors of Colleges, where they were brought vp: ſo are there many in England, who neuer obeyed any Ieſuite. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this argument prooue, that they ſhould euer after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſame men, much leſſe that they ſhould obey all other, who are of that order: yet muſt this be the argument, which is fooliſhly here inſinuated by this authour, or elſe none. For of al the Ieſuits in England there are none, whom theſe prieſts

Beſids that they are al of them inferiour to many prieſts, both for age, learning, wiſedome, gouernment, and what els belongeth to men. But by this hath this authour ſhewed, what his meaning is: that forſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Prieſts haue obeyed ſome Ieſuites, therefore all prieſts muſt be obedient to any of the Ieſuits: yea although he be one, who immediatly before he became a Ieſuite, had ſcant the wit to keepe himſelfe cleane. But for the auoyding of this emulation <hi>it ſeemed</hi> (ſaith this authour) <hi>in all good mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Ieſuites aboue the reſt</hi> (or els all is marred, when you talke of good men) <hi>that the onely, or chiefe remedie would be, to haue this ſubordination of Secular prieſts among themſelues:</hi> but ſo as the <hi>Superiour</hi> muſt be at the Ieſuites direction, as both his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and his practiſe declare. And then followeth a proofe out of a letter of <hi>6.</hi> Aſſiſtants, to cleare the Ieſuits from the procuring of this <hi>ſubordination,</hi> againſt or without the will of the Secular Clergie, which teſtimonie, if the <hi>vnited Prieſts</hi> were the authours of, the <hi>Apologie</hi> is as cleare, as that, of which one requeſted to haue, either his fellow asked, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if he were a thiefe. This teſtimony alſo harpeth vpon the <hi>long day</hi> at Rome, of which we ſpake before, and of the wonders wrought thereupon the 7. of <hi>March,</hi> by certaine letters dated in England in <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> following. Of this letter we ſhal haue occaſion to ſay more in a particular anſwer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And here we will leaue the Reader to wonder onely at this marginall note, fol. 101. <hi>See the letter of ſixe Ancient prieſts the 17. of September 1597.</hi> For he telleth not, where this letter is to be ſeene, but rather leaueth a ſuſpition, that it is yet to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, vnleſſe he thought it too worthy a thing to be inſerted among ſo many fooliſh and friuolous impertinencies, as with which this <hi>Apologie</hi> doth ſwarme. The proofe alſo which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> laboured to haue Biſhops in England, is moſt abſurd in their vnderſtanding, who knowe how he can play on both ſides, and impugne that in which he would ſeem to be moſt forward: he can ſend notes of ſuch things, as hee would pretend a deſire ſhould be kept ſecret, and ſend them round about the world with the ſame deſire of ſecrecie. He can write his letters in exceeding great commendations to one of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:5209:96"/> ſome one man, and at the ſame time write to another, in the diſpraiſe of the ſame man. And is it a ſufficient diſproofe of his backwardneſſe of hauing Biſhops, that he laboured with ſome to haue them in England? Can <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> ſo farre ouerſhoot himſelfe, as to make his credite ſo ſmall in the Court of Rome, as that any thing can be denied him, being aſſiſted by ſuch as expect from him a kingdome or two for their ſeruice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apologie</hi>) <hi>this then being reſolued by his Holines, that he would haue an</hi> Archprieſt <hi>appointed in England, whom all the rest ſhould obey, he gaue commiſsion to the ſaid Cardinall</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>to inſtitute the ſame in his name.</hi> Howe was this made knowen to the Prieſts? Forſooth the Cardinall ſhewed, <hi>that it was his Holineſſe eſpeciall order and commandement by theſe words, Speciali mandato nobis iniunxit; his Holines hath ordained</hi> this <hi>vnto vs by a ſpeciall commandement.</hi> What ſilly boy would thus haue Engliſhed <hi>iniunxit</hi> in this place? or what is that <hi>This,</hi> which his Holineſſe <hi>ordained by a ſpeciall commandement?</hi> the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>ſubordination</hi> with theſe faculties &amp;c. could this man imagine, that the Cardinals letters would neuer againe be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on? or if he could feare that, could he be ſo impudent, as to cite this part thereof, for to prooue his Holineſſe <hi>ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> for the erecting of the Archprieſt? And to prooue, that his Holineſſe was mooued by the aforeſaid reaſons, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him, to wit, <hi>emulation,</hi> and what els pleaſeth him: he citeth theſe words out of the ſame letter of the Cardinall: <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones abipſis ſacerdotibus redditae, &amp;c. the reaſons alleaged by prieſts for this matter, were allowed by his Holineſſe:</hi> and afterwardes he citeth a great part of the letter, for ſo much as concerneth the commendations of the Ieſuits: and the deſire which the Pope hath, that the Ieſuites, and the Prieſts might liue in peace toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>comming from ſo high a ſuperiour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from Christs vicar himſelfe, we doe wonder, how it tooke no more effect within the heartes of our brethren, that impugned the ſame.</hi> And <hi>our brethren wonder,</hi> that any man can bee ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to make ſuch a wonder; confeſſing ſo often as he doth in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> that <hi>Chriſts vicar himſelfe</hi> would not write at all: whereby neither his letters appeared for the inſtitution of this <hi>Archprieſt,</hi> nor any commiſſion by which the Cardinall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5209:97"/> had power to doe it. But the Cardinal his word was ſufficient (ſaith he) and <hi>our brethren</hi> ſay no, and proue it by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of all men of knowledge in the Canon and Ciuill lawes: who ſay, <hi>that the ſole teſtimonie of a Cardinall, is not neceſſarily to be credited in any matter preiudiciall to a third perſon:</hi> yet muſt the <hi>blinde obedient</hi> beleeue, that the prieſts in not obeying the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters, did <hi>directly withſtand Chriſts vicar himſelfe.</hi> But after he hath cited a part of the Cardinals letter, he affirmeth, that all was confirmed afterwards by his Holines owne <hi>Breue:</hi> and that all written by the Cardinall, and euery parcell there of, was by his order, conſent, proper motion, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, written, ordained, and ſent into England. And to this <hi>our brethren</hi> anſwere, that ſo ſoone as they ſawe this, they did preſently ſubmit themſelues vnto the order. And ſay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that this is very fooliſhly brought in, to prooue a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in them, before this <hi>Brcue</hi> was written. And by this is anſwere made to the queſtion following. <hi>But what? did this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie or quiet them, that had reſolued to be vnquiet?</hi> For the prieſts perceiuing ſuch a deuiſe of the Ieſuits, &amp; foreſeeing how here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Ieſuits might vnder a maske play their priſes more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then before, ſent to Rome, as became Catholike prieſts, to know his Hol. pleaſure, &amp; in the meane while, theſe who were <hi>reſolued to be vnquiet,</hi> ſpread Libels abroad againſt the prieſts, and condemned them of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> &amp; much more ſuch religious ſtuffe. The cauſes which moued the prieſts to demur vpon the matters, vntill they ſaw his Hol <hi>Breue,</hi> are ſet downe at large by M. <hi>Io. Collington</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>A iuſt defence &amp;c.</hi> whither we are to referre our Reader: and as for the letter of the <hi>6. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants,</hi> it ſhall haue his place elſewhere, to be anſwered, &amp; for now, we let it paſſe, as a baſe profe of any thing, which is therin affirmed, it being (no doubt) penned by thoſe, who are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed in this <hi>Apologie.</hi> Neither doe the letters of fortie or fiftie prieſts in England egged on, and in a manner compelled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Ieſuits and Archprieſt, to approoue his authority, or giue thankes to his Holines for it, prooue any thing, but a lightneſſe in them, to giue credit where it was not due, euen in a moſt preiudiciall matter againſt themſelues. The praiſes which are here attributed to M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> perſon, no man wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:5209:97"/> more he may deſerue, then I doe: but the teſtimonie which is brought of his falſe dealing, when he firſt manifeſted his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, will goe hard againſt him: and the harder, for the poore ſhifts which are vſed in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> fol. 109. to ſalue them. This author hauing prooued a reſolution in the Pope, and layd downe the ſuppoſed reaſons of the inſtitution of this <hi>ſubordination,</hi> and concluded, that the prieſts were diſobedient to <hi>Chriſts Vicar himſelfe,</hi> yet not hauing the wit to conceale, that his Holines did not write himſelfe any thing, vntil a yeere after, and more: (at the ſight of which letters, the prieſts did inſtantly ſubmit themſelues) hee goeth about now to ſalue the reaſons which the prieſts haue giuen in their bookes, of their forbearance, vntill they ſaw his Holines <hi>Breue:</hi> and telleth his Reader, that hee hath gathered them out of both the two late bookes, the one in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the other in <hi>Latine,</hi> though <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and tumultuouſly</hi> ſet downe in both; and in no one place <hi>diſtinctly</hi> and <hi>in order:</hi> whereby perchance hee might haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued ſome commendation for his good will, had he not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all himſelfe in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> chap. 2. fol. 18. where hee taketh notice of one and twentie reaſons, which are <hi>diſtinctly</hi> and <hi>in order ſet downe</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> booke, and citeth the pages 84, 85, 86, <hi>&amp; deinceps:</hi> and chap. 11. fol. 176. hee acknowledgeth the ſame 21. reaſons to be laid together by <hi>diſtinct</hi> numbers.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon which this author impugneth is, <hi>that it was gotten by wrong and falſe information, by the inſtance of the aduerſe partie onely, againſt their willes, and without their knowledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all equitie and iuſtice:</hi> And this hee impugneth, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that <hi>he hath already ſhewed it to be falſe,</hi> but you muſt goe looke where. The reaſon is defended by M. Doctor <hi>Ely</hi> in his notes vpon the eight chapter of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> pag 226. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther following; and by M. <hi>Iohn Collington</hi> in his firſt reaſon.</p>

Their reaſon is, for that the Pope vſeth to ſend his <hi>Breues</hi> or <hi>Bulls</hi> in matters of leſſe weight then this is, as appeareth by that extrauagant <hi>Iniunctae nobis, de electione:</hi> where all men are forbidden to receiue leſſe prelacies then this was: although this were the meaneſt title that any prelat hath,

M. Doctor <hi>Ely</hi> alſo, Doctor of both lawes, and profeſſor in <hi>Pont à muſſon</hi> in Lorraine, in his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie</hi> from the 116 page to the 137. prooueth this point: where alſo that fooliſh obiection of the eighth priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Card. here cited in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> is anſwered: as alſo by M. <hi>Iohn Collington</hi> pag. 114. and the authour of the <hi>Apologie</hi> iuſtly reprooued for his falſe dealing in citing this impertinent gloſſe: for he leaueth out a part of the ſentence, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his market, and maketh it euident, to what poore ſtraits he is driuen, that muſt cite ſuch a place for himſelfe: which beſides that it maketh not for his purpoſe, it maketh altogether againſt him, in calling that in doubt, vpon which hee would build his argument which he would frame in this maner: The credit of a Card is ſo great, that if he ſhould ſay, he is the Popes Legate, he is to be beleeued, though he ſhew no letters: <hi>ergo</hi> in this, as a matter of leſſe moment, he is to bee beleeued. If a debtor tell his creditor he is a Chriſtian, his creditor will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him: but if he telleth him that he oweth him nothing, I doubt whether he will beleeue him, notwithſtanding he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him in a farre greater matter then forty ſhillings, to wit, that he is a Chriſtian. But to their argument. Firſt it is to bee ſeene, that it is not infallibly true, nor ſo taken generally, that ſuch credit is giuen to a Cardinall: For the ſame gloſſe in the ſame place affirmeth, that ſome do doubt thereof. And M.D. <hi>Ely</hi> affirmeth, that it may be better ſaid, that all do doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo he goeth on pag 125. vpon this point, ſhewing vpon how weake a proofe this <hi>Apologie</hi> ſtandeth. and M. <hi>Iohn Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> prooueth pag 118. that he to whom a cauſe is delegated <hi>by ſpeciall commandement,</hi> is greater in the ſame, then is a Legate generall, and by this is that ſuppoſition alſo maimed, that in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:5209:100"/> our caſe (where the Cardinal is ſaid to haue affirmed, that what he did, he did <hi>by ſpeciall commandement</hi>) hee was inferiour to a Legate, although in very trueth he ſayth not ſo, but onely that he had <hi>a ſpeciall commandement</hi> of his Holineſſe, to doe what he could, for the making vp the breach, which was ſuggeſted to the Pope, to haue been in England betweene the Seminarie prieſts, and Catholikes, as may be ſeene in the letters conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiue, prefixed to M. <hi>Collingtons</hi> booke. And yet to blind ſuch as take pleaſure therein, this author ſpeaking of the Cardinall, demandeth, <hi>who doth not know what a Cardinals teſt monie in any Chriſtian Catholike Court is worth: eſpecially a</hi> Protector, <hi>teſtifying, and profeſsing in his letters patents, to doe it</hi> exſpeciall mandato Sanctiſſimi, <hi>at this man doth in his letters?</hi> As this man doth not in his letters, more then wee now haue ſayd: which was no commiſſion, to make his <hi>Subordination.</hi> Let the letters bee ſought, and it will ſoone be ſeene, that this fellow vſed theſe <hi>Latine</hi> words of his owne, and not out of the Cardinals letters: and that the like words are referred by the Cardinall to ſome other point, then the making of this <hi>Subordination.</hi> But to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the iugling which is vſed betweene the Cardinals <hi>doing it</hi> ſometime, as here <hi>fol. 108.</hi> and his <hi>witneſsing</hi> ſometime, <hi>that his Holineſſe did it:</hi> as it was ſayd in the Libel which D. <hi>Haddocke,</hi> and M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> put vp againſt M.

And if they do not preuaile, you muſt beare the ſhame of your wicked enterpriſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what <hi>holes</hi> are thoſe, which theſe men are ſaid <hi>to ſeeke in their</hi> ſuperiors <hi>coats?</hi> and what <hi>ſuperiors</hi> are they? Marke I pray, how this author diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth himſelfe of this matter: <hi>as theſe men do both againſt the Cardinall</hi> Protector <hi>his auctoritie, and perſon, as alſo the Archprieſt; yea and his Holines alſo in couert words, &amp; ſo far as they dare.</hi> What, man? <hi>ſo farre, is they dare?</hi> what is that, which they would <hi>dare</hi> againſt his Holines? Forſooth <hi>perſwading the people, that he hath beleeued falſe information:</hi> did any man euer dare to ſay: what? and <hi>perſwade the people alſo, that the Pope could beleeue falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi> marry ſir, here was ſuch a nole found in his coate, as himſelfe could neuer haue ſeene. Here was <hi>Chriſts vicar him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> very ſtrangely abuſed: <hi>and thereby appointed a ſubordination moſt inconuenient.</hi> Were all thoſe Popes fooles, whoſe letters are cited in the common Law, <hi>de reſcriptis,</hi> &amp; the Biſhops alſo, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did write in ſuch forme, as they did acknowledge, they might be, and were often miſ-informed, and did many things otherwiſe, then they would haue done, if they had bene truely informed? <hi>Si quando</hi> (ſaith Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, to

For we will patiently beare, that you do not that, which was by bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation ſuggeſted vnto vs.</hi> Other Chapters there are there to be ſeene to this effect, which in this place would be needleſly cited; Onely this will ſuffice, to ſhew that it hath bene long ſince ſeene, that Popes could be falſly informed, and thereby alſo appoint a matter moſt inconuenient. And yet this was neuer taken for a <hi>hole</hi> in the Popes <hi>coat.</hi> But what more is there concerning this <hi>hole, not heard of in the Church before?</hi> The day would <hi>blinde Hugh</hi> faine haue ſeene, and thoſe, that are deafe, would gladly heare, when it was euer <hi>heard of in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> that an Archprieſt was made <hi>Superior</hi> ouer all the Secular cleargie of two whole kingdomes, as now <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> is of England and Scotland. <hi>And that it is againſt all equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and that his Holines could not lawfully appoint it without their conſents.</hi> The accepting of the auctoritie at the ſight of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines <hi>Breue</hi> doeth conuince, that the prieſts neuer ſtood vpon his abſolute authoritie, but vpon the cuſtome, which by Law is alſo confirmed, that they ſhould chuſe their <hi>ſuperior,</hi> which M. D. <hi>Biſhop</hi> touched, and proued in his reply to <hi>F. Parſons</hi> pa. 151. and it is handled ſince more at large by M. D. <hi>Ely</hi> pag. 190. to 196. <hi>And that the meanes by which he had appointed, is inſufficient, binding no man to obey it.</hi> If this man do meane, that the prieſts did not take the Cardinals letter, as ſufficient to binde them to obey it, it is very true, that they thought thoſe <hi>meanes inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and they haue giuen diuers proofes of the inſufficiencie thereof. If he meane any other matter, he muſt explicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:5209:102"/> For other meanes the prieſts did not know, vntil they ſaw the <hi>Breue:</hi> at which time they did all ſubmit themſelues vnto it: <hi>All which muſt argue great inſufficiencie, defect, and lacke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in his Holines proceeding.</hi> They ſhould haue had more honeſtie, who gaue the falſe information: and their fault was the greater, becauſe ſo great a truſt was repoſed in them by his Holines. And to mend theſe <hi>holes</hi> in the Popes <hi>coat</hi> I would gladly vnderſtand, why the two prieſts, who were firſt ſent to his Holines, were clapt vp cloſe priſoners, before they could haue acceſſe vnto him? If his Holines could not <hi>beleeue wrong information,</hi> then might the Ieſuits, and the Sbirri with more credit haue bene at their iayles, then ſeeking to impriſon ſuch as came to <hi>informe</hi> his Holines. If his Holines could <hi>beleeue wrong informations,</hi> and that theſe good men therefore ioyned together to apprehend, and impriſon the two prieſts: then is this <hi>hole</hi> in his Holines <hi>coate</hi> patched vp againe: <hi>that the Prieſts dared to perſwade the people, that he hath beleeued falſe informations:</hi> for this implieth that he could. And thus much for the <hi>holes</hi> in his Holines <hi>coat:</hi> a pretie ſlubbering kinde of anſwere to the prieſts reaſons. The <hi>Protectors</hi> turne ſhould be next, but this author will owe him the patching vp of his <hi>holes,</hi> and will goe helpe the Archprieſt. <hi>And as for the Archprieſt their immediate ſuperior</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though in words they acknowledge his authority, &amp;c. yet doe they ſeeke by all meanes poſsible, to diſcredit both him, his authority, and perſon.</hi> The firſt matters ſeeme to concerne him, and his perſon; as that he is charged about his doubling in his inſtructions, and about an heretical propoſition. But how are theſe things anſwered? the firſt is thus awarded, <hi>We cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how it could be ſpoken:</hi> the ſecond thus. <hi>If M.</hi> Blackwell <hi>ſhould ſay, as wee are ſure hee did not in the ſenſe they take it:</hi> two poore ſhifts. But to the <hi>Apologie</hi> as it lieth. <hi>And here in this place they will needs raiſe a certaine cauill againſt him</hi> (the Archprieſt, or his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>ſaying that he doubled in his ſpeech with</hi> M. Collingt. <hi>and</hi> M. Charnock: <hi>for of their two relations onely all theſe matters are raiſed againſt him</hi> (vt in ore duoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vel trium teſtiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith our Sauiour Matt. 8.) ſtet omne verbum, <hi>that euery thing be tried by two or three witneſſes) when at the firſt comming of the Cardinals letters and inſtructions, he conferred them confidently with theſe two</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:5209:102"/> (but this his <hi>confidence</hi> wrought in him a marueilous confuſion, when hee was taken tardy vpon too great a <hi>confidence</hi> of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly conueyance) <hi>who ſo dutifully interpreted his ſpeeches, as firſt they ſaid he was contrary to himſelfe, and affirmed his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to haue come from Rome together with his letters, which is moſt true, and they are to be ſeene vnder the Cardinals hand and ſeale, &amp;c.</hi> Marke how this matter is ſhuffled vp: He was neuer blamed for ſaying <hi>his inſtructions came from Rome,</hi> which were vnder the Cardinals hand and ſeale, but for ſaying that thoſe inſtructions came from Rome which he ſhewed, and were neuer to be ſeene vnder the Cardinals hand and ſeale, but were of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as he confeſſed, being enforced thereunto, when ſo much was conuinced by the contents, and that he had counterfeited them, which at that time was no little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion vnto him. And thus may any reaſonable man apprehend, how it could be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which (this author ſayth here) <hi>wee cannot apprehend how it could be ſpoken.</hi> We doe further <hi>apprehend how it could be ſpoken,</hi> and to what ende, that he had authoritie <hi>to excommunicate, and ſend prieſts to their anſwere to the Court of Rome,</hi> and how a <hi>nod</hi> could bee giuen toward the next chamber, to inſinuate that there was his commiſſion for this alſo: and yet neuer a worde true of all this which he ſpake. And the thing beeing <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how it could be,</hi> and two prieſts ready to depoſe, that it was ſo, we doe further <hi>apprehend,</hi> that the Archprieſt or his perſon deſerued a greater puniſhment, then his factious adherents would ſhould light vpon him, eſpecially if his inſtructions, which he had ſo falſified, were ſent by his Holines, and onely teſtified by the Card. as ſometimes for an aduantage this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low will vrge. But whither doe we wander, that this fellow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, <hi>how it could be ſpoken?</hi> For the Archprieſt himſelfe could not well tell what hee ſaid, as it ſhould ſeeme by a letter of his of the ſecond of <hi>March</hi> following, being charged with theſe matters: <hi>Sir</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Archpresbyter hath to doe about excommunications, and the ſending to the Court of Rome.</hi> But what? can he excommunicate, or hath he any power to ſend prieſts thither? no ſuch matter. What is it then, that he can do? Marke I pray you his owne words, and how he anſwereth that which was laid to his charge: <hi>For by his commiſsion hee is charged to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:5209:103"/> all ſuch rebellions and contumacies, as are too familiar with you, if they cannot be ſuppreſſed, with his authoritie at home, and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the ſame to the Card.</hi> Protector <hi>his grace, and ſo by his meanes to procure excommunication, or the ſending for to Rome, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of ſuch licentiouſneſſe.</hi> By this logicke then, a power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, is a power to write to thoſe who can procure it. And hee that cannot write to any, that can procure an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, is not worthy to be ſaid, to haue the power him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to excommunicate. But for the inſtructions, note I pray you how hee would ſhift the matter: <hi>And for the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, he neuer ſaid they were all made at Rome.</hi> Indeede there was no cauſe, why he ſhould vſe thoſe particular words neither is the charge ſo to be vnderſtood. Hee is thus charged by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Collington</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> that after the Cardinals letter was read, he put them in mind, that the letter did mention cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inſtructions, which ſhould be annexed thereunto: and therewithall drew a paper out of his boſome, which he did not deliuer vnto them to read (as he had done the letter) but kept it ſtill in his owne hands, affirming that thoſe were the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were meant in the letter, and he read them as ſuch: and being taken in the maner, and conuinced, that they could not be ſuch, he confeſſed that ſome of them were of his owne making. And this will the two prieſts aboue named iuſtifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the world, where this poore ſhift will not ſerue: <hi>he neuer ſaid they were all made at Rome,</hi> nor this new deuiſe: <hi>But that his instructions made at Rome, gaue him authoritie to ſet downe</hi> Rules, <hi>about all particular matters and caſes of ſuch qualitie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they gaue out amongst their friends, that he had ſpoken an hereticall propoſition: whereupon M.</hi> Biſhop <hi>tolde the ſame in Rome, as appeareth in his examination, affirming to haue heard it of his fellow M</hi> Charnocke, <hi>who yet as farre as we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, did ſet downe nothing thereabout in his depoſitions.</hi> Perchance <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> was loath to trouble M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> with any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation: for doubtleſſe, if he had bene asked this queſtion, his anſwere would haue bene here alſo inſerted, eſpecially if he had denied it. The auoiding then of ſuch a queſtion to M <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> muſt needes be ſuſpitious, his examination both being begun before M. <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as appeareth in the 9. chapter of this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:5209:103"/> 
                  <hi>Apologie fol. 129.</hi> and ended ſome 9. or 10. dayes, after M. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> examination, as appeareth in the ſame chapter fol. 134. <hi>And in this latter Engliſh Libell, againe diuers times mention is made thereof by a certaine cenſurer intituled, M.</hi> I. B. <hi>comenting vpon a letter of</hi> Fa. Parſons, <hi>but nothing affirming or denying, but onely entertayning the ſpeech, that an hereticall propoſition had bene obiected, or ſpoken of at Rome againſt the Archprieſt,</hi> There was no place for to handle any propoſition in that cenſure, more then the letter of <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> gaue cauſe, And he gaue no other cauſe then in theſe generall termes: <hi>you tooke the way firſt to diſcredite ſo much as in you lay, M. Blackwell, &amp;c. yea in the very matter of his faith: for that an hereticall propoſition was layd to his charge</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Copies of Diſcourſes.</note> 
                  <hi>pag. 62.</hi> The cenſurer perchance did not know thus much but vpon <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> word: to which he gaue little credit, and therefore vſed thoſe words, pag. 88. <hi>if it ſhould be true which</hi> Fa. Parſons <hi>ſaith in the 17. paragraffe, that M</hi> Blackwell <hi>was touched in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter of his faith, and offereth to prooue it by certaine depoſitions, yet extant at Rome, that an hereticall propoſition was layde to his charge. I doubt their ground for going to Rome will hardly be ſhaken.</hi> And this is the oftener inculcated, becauſe <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> in the ſame letters where he mentioneth this depoſition, doth often affirme, that <hi>there was nothing of ſubſtance brought againſt the Archprieſt pag 55.</hi> And a little after that <hi>their enterpriſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction was without foundation at all. pag. 59.</hi> And againe, that <hi>his Holineſse and the Cardinals were aſhamed, to finde them to haue come ſo long a iourney with ſo little to ſay, pag. 58.</hi> And the cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer thought, that he had diſcharged himſelfe ſufficiently in that action, when he ſhewed how vnaduiſedly <hi>F. Parſons</hi> ſtill ranne vpon this point, that the two prieſts had nothing to ſay worth the handling, and yet confeſſeth that they had to touch, yea and touched M. <hi>Blackwell in the very matter of his faith, pag. 62.</hi> But now this author will ſet it downe more particularly, and anſwere for <hi>Blackwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the propoſition forſooth was, that M. Blackwel ſhould ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that they could not appeale from him to the Pope himſelfe:</hi> well good ſir, how doe you anſwere for M. <hi>Blackwell? which if M. Blackwell ſhould ſay, as we are ſure he did not in the ſenſe they take it.</hi> In what ſenſe doe they take it which the plaine wordes
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:5209:104"/> doe not giue? what a poore ſhift is this to ſay, <hi>if he ſhould ſay it, as we are ſure he did not, in that ſenſe they take it?</hi> Then you are not ſure, that <hi>he did not ſay it,</hi> but that he did not ſay it, <hi>in the ſenſe they take it.</hi> If you ſhould complain that you were ſtriken, would you take it for an argument, that you were not ſtriken, becauſe the ſtriker did not ſtrike you, <hi>in that ſenſe that you take it?</hi> He ſpake it, and ſtood peremptorily in it, after that he was often admoniſhed of the danger thereof, by M. <hi>Collington,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke:</hi> and this flying to <hi>ſenſes,</hi> which are ſo ſecret, as they may not be knowen, nor can be imagined to bee other, then the words doe giue, bewrayeth too much guiltineſſe. But marke, I pray you another ſhift, at a dead lift. <hi>If M.</hi> Blackwell <hi>ſhould ſay it, &amp;c. yet many men in the world may ſay this in diuerſe cauſes, wherein appeale is cut off by his Holineſſe conſent, and order.</hi> Doth the power which is in other men in the world, giue M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> a warrant, to ſay this or that, becauſe they can ſay it? If many men in the world may ſay, that appeale is not to be made from them to the Pope himſelfe, many men in the world may ſay more then becommeth them, but in ſuch caſes, as <hi>wherein appeale is cut off by his Holineſse conſent and order.</hi> Which <hi>conſent and order</hi> they are to ſhew, or to be taken for ſuch, as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> was taken; that is, either very ignorant, or a worſe thing. Such Commiſſions are commonly granted with this clauſe <hi>appellatione remota,</hi> or ſome other equiualent, which can not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Cardinals letters, or his inſtructions, which were all the commiſſion which he had, when he ſtoode vpon this point: nor to this day is <hi>appellation</hi> from him <hi>to the ſea of Rome cut off by any conſent or order</hi> of his Holineſſe, although the <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of Auguſt 1601. doth not admit of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, his Holineſſe being perſwaded, that it could not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without further trouble. And if he had this clauſe from his Holineſſe himſelfe in any commiſſion <hi>Appellatione remota,</hi> yet would no man of vnderſtanding affirme, that the Prieſtes could not appeale from him to the Pope himſelfe, according to that chapter. <hi>Paſtoralis de officio &amp; poteſtate iudicis delegati.

If the Pope hath wittingly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:5209:104"/> committed an appellation, which was made from his delegate, who was delegated with this clauſe</hi> appellatione remota, <hi>(without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any appeale) the iuriſdiction of that first delegate is the meane while ſuſpended from any execution: Donec</hi> (ſaith Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the third, out of whoſe words the Rubricke is made) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationis merita plenius ſint diſcuſſa: vntill the cauſes of the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be diſcuſſed.</hi> And <hi>Launcelot lib. 3. tit. de Appell. Interdum non obſtante prohibitione appellari poterit. Sometime it is lawfull to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale notwithſtanding the prohibition.</hi> And he putteth ſome caſes for example. <hi>Licèt cauſa</hi> (appellatione remota) <hi>commiſsa fuerit: although the cauſe were committed with this clauſe,</hi> appellatione remota, <hi>without admitting any appeale:</hi> ſo that whatſoeuer this authour of the <hi>Apologie</hi> ſayth, few men will ſay ſo much, as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſaid: Although appellation from them be ſometimes cut off with his Holineſſe <hi>conſent,</hi> and <hi>order:</hi> and much leſſe where there was no ſuch cutting off, as may be ſeene in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by which he was inſtituted Archprieſt. Beſides that, theſe were not his Holineſſe letters, but the Cardinall <hi>Caietans:</hi> and therefore as yet was there leſſe cauſe to ſtand ſo peremptorily vpon this point, as <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> did, after that he was tolde of his errour. <hi>And if M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>in conſcience had thought this to haue bene hereſie, or hereticall, he was bound vnder paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (eſpecially being in Rome) to haue proſecuted the matter, &amp;c. M. Charnocke</hi> might haue thought that it was <hi>hereſie or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,</hi> and might haue had the purpoſe to <hi>proſecute it in Rome:</hi> who can ſay the contrary? But then why did he not? perchance becauſe it ranne in his mind, as good neuer a whit, as neuer the better. Perchance he might dreame that <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> had ſome ſecret ſenſe, contrary to the purport of the wordes, and ſay, that he meant all well. What if it were ſet downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among thoſe notes, which the Popes officer tooke from him, as <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> inſinuated in his letter to M D. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which is in <hi>The copies of diſcourſes,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>pag. 62. Moreouer it appeareth by your papers and depoſitions yet extant, that you tooke the way firſt to diſcredit (ſo much as in you lay) M.</hi> Blackwell <hi>&amp;c. yea in the very matter of his faith.</hi> And if M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> did depoſe, that he heard ſuch a matter of M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> how farre were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers bound, <hi>eſpecially at Rome,</hi> to proſecute this matter, it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5209:105"/> being there depoſed in that manner? Or where ſhould M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> haue proſecuted it, being cloſe priſoner, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his aduerſaries to be kept, examined, and haue all his words and actions interpreted by them, and was debarred of conference with any but them; whereby hee might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue there was no fit place for him to deale in any matter, but what the Ieſuites would like of, and their adherents: in ſo much as if <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> haue any trueth in him, the Pope was hardly brought to thinke, that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> &amp; he were Catholike prieſts? And was this (trow you) a conuenient place, or time for him to enter into any courſe (had he bene otherwiſe bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) againſt another, eſpecially ſuch a man, as whoſe diſcredite would be ſo great a blowe vnto <hi>M. Charnockes</hi> Iaylor, as hee could not haue had the like in the Court of Rome? But how hangeth that together which followeth; <hi>and not hauing done ſo</hi> (that is, proſecuted this matter at Rome) <hi>and yet procuring in theſe late libels to renue the ſpeech thereof againe.</hi> How is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? <hi>It is eaſely ſeene, that their intention:</hi> now he is fallen from <hi>M. Charnockes</hi> ſuppoſed acte, to <hi>their intention:</hi> as though, if it had bene true, that <hi>M Charnocke</hi> had procured to renue thoſe ſpeeches, and that all thoſe friends had forgotten it, amongſt whom in this place the <hi>Apologie</hi> confeſſeth it was giuen out, the <hi>intention</hi> of the reſt could be d ſcouered to be <hi>onely to diſcredite the perſon of their ſuperiour in what they may, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a bad kind of obedience.</hi> He may ſweare it, for it was neuer heard that the acte of diſcrediting of a man, was an act of obedience, vnleſſe the <hi>Superiour</hi> would giue ſuch a fooliſh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement againſt himſelfe, which <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> will neuer do, as we hope. And although that theſe bookes were printed, as here it is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, after that <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> was made a lawfull <hi>Superiour,</hi> (to wit by his Holineſſe <hi>Breue</hi>) yet theſe matters were touched (as long paſt before the <hi>Breue</hi> came, and at ſuch time, as hee was deemed to be intruded, without his Holineſſe knowledge) to ſhew what iuſt cauſes the Prieſts had, to be aduiſed before they ſhould reſolue, to ſubiect themſelues vnto him.</p>
               <p>After this long paine, to finde <hi>holes in Superiors coates,</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is fallen againe into the prieſts reaſons, among which hee citeth thoſe, which wee haue now once already anſwered, to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:5209:105"/> wit, <hi>that his Holineſſe could not do it lawfully without their conſents, and that the election pertained vnto them, and the like.</hi> One newe deuiſe he hath for ſome varietie, as <hi>for that it is a forreine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ſubiect to danger of</hi> Premunire, which is anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the prieſts did not plead this, or giue it as a reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authority, but alleaged it as the opinion onely of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men of iudgement in the lawes of our countrey, as may be ſeene in the ſixt page of the Engliſh booke, and prooued thereby, that in wiſedome they might pauſe vpon their ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues vnto the authority, ſeeing no other warrant for it, then a Cardinals letter, to whom they knew no tye of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, much leſſe in a matter of ſo great moment. And that this was all which they did, it is euident in that ſo ſoone, as they did ſee his Holineſſe letter (whom they knew to be their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour) they all yeelded themſelues. And as it is ſayd before, if our princes of the ſame religion, of which we were, did puniſh ſuch as accepted of any dignities by prouiſion from Rome, without their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſents, the prieſts might aſſuredly expect ſome ſeueritie of a prince of a contrary religion. And as they were not bound to accept thereof, before it was confirmed by his Holineſſe, ſo did they thinke it great follie to exaſperate the ſtate any more againſt them, by accepting of ſo ſtrange and needles a noueltie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And theſe reaſons</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apologie</hi>) <hi>are ſet downe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in two of the firſt treatiſes of this Engliſh booke intituled,</hi> Copies of diſcourſes, which were written before the <hi>Breue</hi> came foorth for confirmation of the Archprieſt: and therefore they ought to haue bene anſwered according to that time, not with this idle ſhift: <hi>His Holines Inſtitution.</hi> For as then it was not knowen, that it was <hi>his Holineſſe Inſtitution,</hi> as here is confeſſed in theſe words, <hi>Before the</hi> Breue <hi>came foorth. And conſequently it ſeemeth ſtrange to vs, why they were now permitted after the</hi> Breue <hi>is foorth, and hath not wrought that effect for quieting them, which then they promiſed</hi> What then will this fellow ſay to all the teſtimonies brought by himſelfe, to proue the peace was made at the ſight of the <hi>Breue</hi> Cap. 10. <hi>Apol?</hi> what will he anſwere to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Breue</hi> of the ſeuenteenth of <hi>Auguſt 1601,</hi> where his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe auoucheth it that all was preſently ended vpon the ſight
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:5209:106"/> of his <hi>Breue</hi> of the ſixt of <hi>Aprill 1599.</hi> His riddle then is thus read: that the <hi>Breue</hi> did worke that effect in the prieſts, which they promiſed, as we haue now ſhewed. But not long after the Ieſuits began to ſpread abroad, and that the prieſts, who obeyed not, before they ſaw the <hi>Breue,</hi> were <hi>ſchiſmaticks:</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt was ſo farre from controlling this reuiued faction of the Ieſuits, as hee publiſhed a <hi>reſolution</hi> pretended to come from Rome, that the refuſers of his authoritie were <hi>ſchiſmatikes.</hi> And <hi>now</hi> it will not ſeeme ſtrange to a reaſonable man, that theſe <hi>diſcourſes were now printed,</hi> for that <hi>now</hi> there was need to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Catholickes, that the prieſts were not then <hi>ſchiſmatikes:</hi> which perſwaſion the prieſts thought it fit to further, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the true ſtate of matters, how they then ſtood, and vpon what reaſons. And theſe were beſt, and moſt ſincerely to be ſhewed by the letters, which paſſed at that time to and fro, and by laying downe the cauſes, which then they had, and might haue, to deferre their obedience, vntill they ſaw the <hi>Breue:</hi> and thereby giue ſatisfaction to Catholickes, that they had not been <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> as the Ieſuites and Archprieſt began now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine after the peace made, to publiſh againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now after theſe treatiſes</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>enſueth an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of M.</hi> Anthony Champneys, <hi>which we would hardly beleeue to bee his, if he had not ſuffered his name to be put downe in print to the ſame. For we had greater opinion both of his diſcretion, learning, and modeſtie, then that hee would vtter ſuch things as in this epiſtle are contained: eſpecially matter of ſo much gall againſt the Fathers of the</hi> ſocietie, <hi>vnder whom he hath bene brought vp, and of whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for diuers yeeres (as we are informed) hee ſought to bee,</hi> Note this author his opinion of M. <hi>Champneys diſcretion, learning and modeſtie,</hi> and how that this opinion muſt no longer laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maintaineth his good name againſt the ſlaunderous tongues of the Ieſuites, and their aſſociates, in their vniuſt accuſation of <hi>Schiſme, and diſobedience.</hi> And whoſoeuer ſhall reade his Epiſtle, which is heere mentioned, ſhall perceiue great cauſe, why that good and reuerent opinion was rather to be ſtill kept by that <hi>Epistle,</hi> then the leaſt iot diminiſhed, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhewed very <hi>diſcreetely, learnedly,</hi> and <hi>modeſtly,</hi> how wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he, and other graue and reuerend Catholicke prieſts were
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:5209:106"/> charged by the Ieſuites and their adherents. But this ſeemeth very ſtrange to many, that there being ſo reuerend an opinion of his <hi>diſcretion, learning, and modeſtie,</hi> as this author affirmeth, they would not admit him into their order, hauing ſought it for <hi>diuers yeeres,</hi> as here is affirmed. Will hee perchance haue his reader to vnderſtand, that a man of <hi>diſcretion, learning, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie,</hi> cannot well ſuite with that religious order? or that ſuch men are not thought fit for ſuch purpoſes, as the <hi>maſter of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule</hi> would effect in our countrey, who now hath the diſpoſing of our Engliſh Ieſuites, and is of opinion perchance, that the further off a man is from <hi>diſcretion, learning, and modeſtie,</hi> the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will he be to further his deſignes, and hath for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his nouices, or encouragement to other, written this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,</hi> and ſhewed that he himſelfe hath neither <hi>diſcretion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor modeſtie,</hi> or elſe that his inſtruments muſt haue defect at the leaſt in ſome one or two of theſe three vertues, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Treatiſe of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and his abettors therein, who were thought to haue had ſome <hi>learning,</hi> but they haue giuen an earneſt penny in that Treatiſe, that they neither had <hi>diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, modeſtie, nor learning?</hi> And M. <hi>Champney</hi> might be thought to be highly fauoured of God, that he eſcaped ſo great a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſeeking it himſelfe for <hi>diuers yeeres</hi> (as here is ſaid) although no doubt he might haue bene of the ſocietie, and haue taken ſuch good and religious courſes, as we doubt not but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that order doe. <hi>But thoſe commonly</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>are worſe when they looſe their ſpirit, ſeeking to pacifie the remorſe of their owne conſcience, by deuiſing defects againſt them whome they left.</hi> See how this fellow doubleth in his tale. If M. <hi>Champney</hi> ſought <hi>for diuers yeeres</hi> to be of the ſocietie, why was he not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they hauing an opinion of him to be of <hi>diſcretion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and modeſtie?</hi> could he doe any more then <hi>to ſeeke it,</hi> and to perſeuere in ſeeking it <hi>for diuers yeeres,</hi> as here is confeſſed? how is hee charged to haue left them? Is it not rather euident that they would not admit him? Againe, I would faine knowe what <hi>remorſe of conſcience</hi> it is, which a man of <hi>diſcretion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and modeſtie,</hi> can haue, for miſſing that, for the effecting of which he did the vttermoſt, which hee could morally doe. He ſought it, you ſay, <hi>for diuers yeeres:</hi> and is hee to be charged
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:5209:107"/> with any thing, of which he ſhould haue <hi>remorſe of conſcience:</hi> he ſhould perchance haue continued ſtill that mind to be a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, but muſt haue deſerued it by ſome emploiment vnder you; in which if hee had not had that plauſible ſucceſſe which you deſired, the Secular prieſts muſt haue borne the ſhame thereof, becauſe whatſoeuer he was in deſire, or in the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in his ſtate he had been no other then a Secular prieſt. <hi>And ſo by this Epistle he payeth all his former obligations vnto them, by as hatefull ſpeeches as commonly any enemy could vtter.</hi> This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath ſhewed you the <hi>obligations</hi> which M. <hi>Champney</hi> had vnto them, which perchance were <hi>obligations</hi> in them toward him, in that he perſeuered <hi>diuers yeeres,</hi> ſeeking to be of them, and was likely to haue beene a greater credit vnto them, then any of our nation, which haue bene employed here in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh affaires, being accounted a man of <hi>diſcretion, learning, and modeſtie.</hi> And can any man thinke, that if there were any <hi>hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> againſt the Societie, that this author would not mention them? <hi>But leauing this</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>we come to the point it ſelfe, wherein hee ſheweth as little ſound iudgement of learning, as any other that had his hand in the booke.</hi> Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that it be remembred, how that this author dealeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, who otherwiſe hath bene eſteemed <hi>diſcreete, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and modeſt,</hi> which qualities were neuer known to haue had greater aduerſaries then <hi>indiſcretion, ignorance, and immodeſtie.</hi> And here theſe ſhew themſelues now againſt M. <hi>Champney</hi> his <hi>learning, diſcretion, and modeſtie. For firſt</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>hee will needs take vpon him in this</hi> Epiſtle <hi>to prooue, that he and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes had great reaſon in doing as they did, and that it neither was nor is any ſinne or diſobedience at all: for (ſayth he) to diſobey, is to reſiſt, contemne, and impugne the knowen commandement of a</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. His reaſons (good Sir) you are contented to let them reſt for this time: and you imploy your talent againſt this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> in which you haue offended againſt <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie,</hi> as we take it, in that you would ſo boldly relate his words with falſhood. Is it all one with you, <hi>It is midday, or midnight;</hi> and, <hi>it is midday, and midnight?</hi> His words are, <hi>reſiſt, contemne, or impugne:</hi> and you cite them, <hi>reſiſt, contemne, and impugne.</hi> And in the margent you make this note, <hi>The large definition of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:5209:107"/> deuiſed for excuſe of the</hi> troubleſome. Know you what you ſay? If this be the large <hi>definition of diſobedience,</hi> how doe you here exclude out of it the <hi>diſobedience</hi> of <hi>Adam, Saul,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> whome you confeſſe to haue diſobeyed, and ſinned by their <hi>diſobedience?</hi> yea you deduce the matter in ſuch ſort, as you prooue this definition to be onely of that diſobedience, which is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. For thus you argue ſpeaking of <hi>Samuel: He did not ſay to</hi> Saul, <hi>why diddest thou reſiſt, contemne, or impugne, which is not onely</hi> diſobedience, <hi>but rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and obſtination, of which</hi> obſtination <hi>S. Thomas in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by M. Champney cited, affirmeth to be the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt?</hi> And yet in the margent, you will make a note, That this is a <hi>large definition of</hi> diſobedience, <hi>deuiſed for the excuſe of the</hi> troubleſome. <hi>For which hee</hi> (M. Champney) <hi>citeth S. Thomas</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>2.2 quaeſt. 104. art. 1. &amp; quaeſt. 105 per totum. But here we would aske M.</hi> Champney, <hi>that came ſo late from his ſtudie, whether to euery ſinfull diſobedience, yea mortall ſinne, it be needfull that the diſobedient ſhould reſiſt, contemne, and impugne, or whether S. Thomas in theſe places by him alledged, doth define any ſuch thing, and not the plaine contrary?</hi> In the abſence of Maſter <hi>Champney,</hi> who perchance at his returne will giue ſome larger ſatisfaction, it is for this time anſwered: Firſt, that here is a iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>mortall ſinne, and diſobedience,</hi> as if M. <hi>Champney</hi> did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to define <hi>euery mortall ſinne,</hi> and not the ſinne of <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Secondly, it is anſwered directly to the queſtion: firſt, concerning <hi>euery mortall ſinne,</hi> that to <hi>euery mortall ſinne</hi> it is needfull that the diſobedient ſhould <hi>reſiſt, contemne, or impugne,</hi> according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> here cited, <hi>quaeſt. 104. art. 3. in corpore.</hi> Theſe are his words: <hi>Sicut peccatum conſiſtit in hoc, quod homo, contempto Deo, commutabilibus bonis inhaeret: As ſinne conſiſteth in this, that man (God being contemned) doth follow ſuch a good as is ſubiect to change.</hi> And now concerning <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> it is alſo anſwered, that the <hi>diſobedient,</hi> not as an <hi>adulterer</hi> or a <hi>thiefe,</hi> but as <hi>diſobedient</hi> doth <hi>reſiſt, contemne, or impugne,</hi> not onely virtually (as euery ſinner doth, according to S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> cited immediatly before, and which were enough to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie M. <hi>Champneys</hi> wordes in euery mortall diſobedience) but actually. And in this ſence doth <hi>Nauar.</hi> in his <hi>Manuel. cap. 23.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5209:108"/> nu. 35.</hi> define <hi>diſobedience. Inobedientia</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>prout eſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciale vitium, eſt vitium inclinans ad non faciendum, quod iubetur, eo principalitèr, quòd iubetur: Diſobedience as it is a ſpeciall vice,</hi> (that is, as diſobedience) <hi>is a vice inclining not to doe that which is commanded, principally becauſe it is commanded.</hi> And for this he citeth S. <hi>Thomas 2.2. quaeſt. 104.</hi> and then hee addeth this: <hi>Ita quod ex duobus conficitur inobedientia ſpecialis, ſcilicet ex non faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo iuſſum, &amp; ex animo non faciendi illud, eo principalitèr quòd iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur: So that diſobedience (as diſobedience) conſiſteth of two things, to wit, of not doing that which is commanded; and of a minde not to doe it, principally becauſe it is commaunded.</hi> S. <hi>Thomas quaeſt. 104. ar. 2. ad primum,</hi> ſayth directly of <hi>diſobedience</hi> (as it is a ſpeciall vice, that is, as diſobedience.) <hi>Ad inobedientiam requiritur, quod actualiter contemnat praeceptum: In diſobedience it is to be required, that the commandement be actually contemned.</hi> And <hi>quaeſt. 105. ar. 1. ad primum: Nec etiam omne peccatum mortale eſt, inobedientia propriè, &amp; per ſe loquendo, ſed ſolum tunc, quando aliquis praeceptum contemnit, quia ex fine morales actus ſpeciem habent: Cum autem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit aliquid contra praeceptum, non propter praecepti contemptum, ſed propter aliquid aliud est inobedientia materialiter tantùm ſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet formaliter ad aliam ſpeciem peccati.</hi> That is, <hi>Neither is euery mortall ſinne a diſobedience, if we ſpeake properly, but only then when the commandement is contemned, becauſe morall actions take their nature of their end: But when a man doth any thing againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, not vpon contempt of the commaundement, but vpon ſome other motiue, it is onely materially a diſobedience, but formally it appertaineth to another kind of ſinne:</hi> and is called for example, <hi>pride, couetouſnes, theft,</hi> or ſuch like not <hi>diſobedience.</hi> By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that M. <hi>Champney</hi> is vniuſtly blamed: &amp; that the author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> may as yet goe to M. <hi>Champney</hi> his lecture: and in the meane while if he would be ſilent, he might be taken for a iolly fellow. But who is ſo bolde as blinde bayard? And thus he runneth on. <hi>For if it be true that no man doeth ſinne by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but he onely who doeth reſiſt, contemne, and impugne,</hi> (<hi>M. Champneys</hi> words are, <hi>or impugne) his ſuperiors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, how was Adams offence ſo greatly puniſhed in him, &amp; his poſterity? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet we doe not reade, that he did reſiſt, contemne, or impugne the Commandement of God Almighty about the apple: but onely did ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:5209:108"/> diſobey by eating the ſame which was forbidden.</hi> We might here make anſwere out of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that there was a contempt: for ſo <hi>hee</hi> ſaith, <hi>Queſt. 104. ar. 3. in corp. peccatum conſiſtit in hoc quod homo contempto Deo &amp;c. Sinne conſiſteth in this, that man (God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned) doth follow ſuch a good as is ſubiect to change.</hi> And if reply be made, that it is no <hi>actuall contempt;</hi> I will aske where they read this word <hi>actuall</hi> in <hi>M. Champneys</hi> definition of <hi>diſobedience?</hi> But to make this matter more cleare, I demaund of this author whether that this ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> were a ſinne of <hi>diſobedience</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally; that is, the ſame which is called <hi>peccatum inobedientiae</hi> or no? If he anſwer affirmatiuely, then he muſt confeſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of S. Thomas queſt. 104 ar. 2. ad. 1. that there was an <hi>actuall contempt.</hi> If he anſwere negatiuely, and that it was ſome other ſinne, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> affirmeth <hi>queſt.</hi> 150. ar. 2. ad 3. that it was <hi>pride</hi> and not <hi>diſobedience,</hi> otherwiſe then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne may in a generall terme be called <hi>diſobedience,</hi> then is not this example to the purpoſe. For M. <hi>Champney</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>pride,</hi> but <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and not <hi>diſobedience</hi> in the largeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as here it is fooliſhly noted in the margent (which as S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſaith queſt. 104. ar. 2. ad. primum, is <hi>a generall ſinne,</hi> as <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> may be a <hi>generall vertue</hi> if <hi>obedience</hi> be taken for an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing, which may be commanded, and <hi>diſobedience</hi> for an omitting to do the ſame, vpon whatſoeuer intention) but <hi>diſobedience</hi> (as <hi>diſobedience,</hi>) to which S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith in the ſame place is neceſſarily required, that the commandement be <hi>actually contemned.</hi> The ſame anſwere is to be made to the next inſtance, which this author giueth againſt M. <hi>Champney</hi> his definition of <hi>diſobedience. Neither do we read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Achan <hi>in the ſpoile of</hi> Iericho <hi>did reſiſt, contemne, or impugne the commandement of</hi> Ioſhua, <hi>that nothing ſhould be touched, or ſaued of the goods of that towne, but being delighted with ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, held it to himſelfe.</hi> See how this fellow minſeth the matter, <hi>being delighted with ſome part thereof, held it to himſelfe.</hi> Whereas the words of <hi>Acan</hi> Ioſ. the 7. are theſe, <hi>concupiſcens abstuli, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them I tooke them away.</hi> By which it is euident, that his ſinne was <hi>couetouſnes,</hi> and not <hi>diſobedience,</hi> but in that large maner, in which the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and euery mortal ſinne according to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> might be called <hi>diſobedience.</hi> And if this author will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:5209:109"/> auouch, that it was <hi>formall diſobedience,</hi> that is, the ſpeciall vice of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> then do we ſay according to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that there was an <hi>actuall contempt.</hi> The third inſtance is of King <hi>Saul</hi> for his ſparing the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and retaining ſome part of their goods: <hi>for the which</hi> (ſaith this author) Samuel <hi>ſaid vnto him, Quare non audisti vocem Domini? why diddeſt thou not heare, or obey the Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God vttered to me? He did not ſay, Why diddest thou reſiſt, contemne, or impugne? which is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſobedience, but rebellion, and obſtination; of which obſtination S.</hi> Thomas (<hi>in the queſtion by</hi> M. Champney <hi>cited</hi>) <hi>affirmeth to be ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: Non omnis, &amp;c.</hi> I firſt demand of this author, what hee thinketh of this ſinne of <hi>Saul,</hi> what kinde of ſinne, or what name it had in ſpeciall? S. <hi>Thomas</hi> aboue cited ſaith, that the name of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>Acan</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that his ſinne was <hi>couetouſnes.</hi> Now are we to finde out the name of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne. If credit may be giuen to <hi>Lyra</hi> at the very beginning of his Comment vpon the 15. Chap of the firſt booke of the Kings, whence this ſtory is taken, the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Saul</hi> was, Ex cupiditate, &amp; ſuperbia, <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couetouſnes, and pride,</hi> ſo that then this muſt be the name of his ſinne, and then is the ſame anſwere made to this inſtance, which was made to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if this author will contend, that his ſinne was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>pride,</hi> nor <hi>couetouſneſſe,</hi> he muſt tell vs, what he will haue it called. And if he will haue it to haue no other name, but <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and that it was that ſpeciall ſinne, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>diſobedience:</hi> then doe I ſay according to S. <hi>Thomas, queſt. 104. ar. 2. ad. primum,</hi> that there was an actuall contempt. But the Prophet did not ſay, <hi>Why didſt thou reſiſt, contemne, or impugne?</hi> How then good Sir, I perceiue the ſpirit is not cleane gone from you as yet, in which you offered to take your oath, to a Gentleman in the <hi>Temple</hi> a little before your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer, that you neither then were, nor euer meant to be <hi>a Papiſt.</hi> You cannot be ignorant what ſort of people do ground their arguments againſt the Catholikes, vpon ſuch negatiue propoſitions. <hi>The Prophet</hi> (ſay you) <hi>did not ſay, why didſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, contemne, or impugne?</hi> But if it alſo be found, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did ſay thus much, where then will ye ſay your ſpectacles were, if you did reade out the Chapter? or if you did not reade
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:5209:109"/> it out, what blind bayard would haue bene ſo bold as to affirme peremptorily that the Prophet did not ſay ſo? I reade in the 23 verſe, <hi>Pro eo quod abieciſti ſermonem Domini &amp;c. Becauſe thou haſt contemptuouſly caſt away the commandement of God:</hi> &amp; verſe <hi>26. Etait Samuel ad Saul, non reuertar tecum: And Samuel ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saul, I will not returne with thee.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Quia proicciſti ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem Domini:</hi> or <hi>Quia ſpreuistiverbum Domini,</hi> (as <hi>Lyra</hi> ſaith according to another editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>becauſe thou diddeſt deſpiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God.</hi> You could content your ſelfe with thoſe words, <hi>Quare non audiſti? Why didſt thou not heare?</hi> and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoſe which followed in the ſame chapter, which doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contempt. But yet make your anſwere, whether you will haue this act of <hi>Saul,</hi> a formall acte of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and then you are told, that according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> here muſt be <hi>an actuall contempt,</hi> or ſome other mortall ſinne. And then, although according to the doctrine alſo of S <hi>Thomas,</hi> it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at the leaſt a vertual contempt: which if you confeſſe, you cannot impugne M. <hi>Champney</hi> his definition, yet is not your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ought worth againſt the definition of <hi>diſobedience</hi> as it is a ſpeciall ſin, which and no other ſin was defined by M <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> But marke I pray you another point of this authors diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>He</hi> (Samuel) <hi>did not ſay, why didst thou reſiſt, contemne, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne, which is not only diſobedience, but rebellion, and obſtination, of which obſtination S. Thomas in the queſtion by M.</hi> Champney <hi>cited, affirmeth to be ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: Non omnis inobedientia</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eſt peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Spiritum ſanctum, ſed ſolum illa cui obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio adhibetur: Not euery diſobedience is ſinne againſt the holy Ghost, but that onely whereto is adioyned obſtination.</hi> Is euery ſinne of diſobedience, I ſay not of <hi>theft,</hi> nor <hi>murther</hi> nor ſuch like, but of <hi>diſobedience</hi> formally taken, as here M. <hi>Champney</hi> doth define it) a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt? This is a very ſtrange doctrine, that a man that obeyeth not, becauſe he will not obey, ſhall be ſayd to ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: yet doth this followe of this doctrine in the <hi>Apologie: for</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>to reſiſt, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, or to impugne, is rebellion and obſtination, of which S Thomas ſayth is a ſinne againſt the holy Ghost:</hi> but as S <hi>Thomas</hi> affirmeth <hi>queſt. 104. art. 2. ad primum. Ad inobedientiam &amp;c. It is required to diſobedience, as diſobedience, that there bee an actuall contempt,</hi> therefore euery diſobedience, as diſobedience, is a ſinne againſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:5209:110"/> the holy Ghoſt. A very faire piece of diuinitie; yet well fitting the diuine author of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> who, had he had the leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, although he had no diuinitie, he would not haue vſed S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in this ſort: For in the very place where he had his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth him (if he had had the wit, or the grace to haue learned) that <hi>not the contempt of euery hinderance of ſinne, doeth make a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy Ghost</hi> (by which alſo he explicateth what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by obſtination) <hi>for then the contempt of euery thing that good is, ſhould be a ſinne against the holy Ghost, becauſe by euery good thing a man may be hindered from ſinne. Sed bonorum illorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus facit peccatum in Spiritum ſanctum, quae directè ducunt ad poenitentiam, &amp; remiſsionem peccatorum: But the contempt of that good doth make a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which good doth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leade to penance, or repentance, and remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> So that the general doctrine here ſet downe in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and fathered vpon S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> is ſhewed out of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> to bee very falſe doctrine, and onely that <hi>contempt</hi> is to bee accounted a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is a contempt of ſuch goodneſſe, or good things, as directly doe bring a man to penance, or repentance, and remiſſion of his ſinnes. Theſe good prefaces being made by the author of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> hee would ſeeme to drawe to ſome point: in which if you marke him, you ſhall finde his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to S.</hi> Thomas <hi>doctrine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alſo by other ſchoolemen, and moſt briefly and cleerely by</hi> Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane <hi>in his</hi> Summe, <hi>a man may commit damnable ſinne by</hi> diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>two wayes. Firſt, formally and properly, when hee reſolueth not to obey, which includeth contempt. And of this meaneth S.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, <hi>when he ſayth: Ad inobedientiam requiritur, quod actualiter contemnat quis ſpeciale preceptum. It is required to inobedience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally taken; that a man doe contemne actually the particular precept of his</hi> Superiour. <hi>queſt. 105. ar. 2. ad prim.</hi> Now then there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing but for this Author to ſhew, that when M. <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> did define <hi>diſobedience,</hi> he did not define <hi>diſobedience,</hi> as <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> and as it is formally taken, but for example <hi>theft, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or ſome ſuch other ſinne. His plaine words are of <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> preciſely, and nothing els, and all his diſcourſe is to proue
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:5209:110"/> that there was no <hi>diſobedience.</hi> And will any man doubt, but that he defined <hi>diſobedience</hi> as <hi>diſobedience?</hi> Hath not this author brought himſelfe into a good caſe, that after all this girding at M <hi>Champney</hi> for ſaying that <hi>diſobedience</hi> (he ſayd not <hi>theft</hi> nor <hi>murder,</hi> but <hi>diſobedience</hi>) did include <hi>a contempt,</hi> and now this author confeſſeth ſo much, and can bring S. <hi>Thomas</hi> to prooue it, (although he miſtake the queſtion; for it is in the <hi>104. queſt.</hi>) whom M. <hi>Champney</hi> cited, and this author affirmed before very boldly, that <hi>S.</hi> Thomas <hi>did not onely not define any ſuch thing,</hi> as M. <hi>Champney</hi> cited, <hi>but the plaine contrary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs ſee how this author proceedeth in his diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the definition giuen of <hi>diſobedience; wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to S.</hi> Thomas <hi>doctrine</hi> (but you muſt go looke where) <hi>declared alſo by other Schoolemen; and moſt briefly and clearly by</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietane <hi>in his Summe,</hi> (in the margent is this note, Caietane <hi>in ſumma, verbo Obedientia,) A man may commit damnable ſinne by</hi> diſobedience <hi>two wayes, Firſt formally, and properly, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo he goeth forward &amp; proueth no more then M. <hi>Champney</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to wit, that there is an <hi>actuall contempt</hi> in <hi>diſobedience,</hi> as diſobedience is of it ſelfe a ſinne. But when he commeth to the other way of ſinning by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> (which is ſome two leaues after) he changeth his termes, and telleth his tale of a <hi>materiall diſobedience,</hi> and flieth off from the ſinning <hi>by diſobedience,</hi> which he ſhould haue followed: for ſo are his words. <hi>A man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit damnable ſinne by</hi> diſobedience <hi>two wayes, Firſt formally, and properly.</hi> This is one way: the other then belike muſt be <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and improperly,</hi> which member is of his owne deuiſe. And neither <hi>S.

Diſobedience is two wayes incurred. Firſt, as it is a diſobedience: that is, when there is an intention not to obey,</hi> and this he calleth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, a formall diſobedience. <hi>Incurritur autem inobedientia materialiter, quandocum<expan>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:5209:111"/> diſobedience (or diſobedience materially taken) is incurred, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a man doeth againſt the Commandements of God, or his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, not with intention of diſobeying, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other intention:</hi> &amp; tunc inobedientia non eſt ſpeciale peccatum, ſed concurrit generaliter cum omni peccato, in quantum in eo eſt inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia Dei &amp;c. <hi>And then diſobedience is not a ſpeciall ſinne, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth generally with euery ſinne, foraſmuch as diſobedience to God is in that ſinne.</hi> So that according to <hi>Caietane,</hi> a man doeth not commit damnable ſin two wayes by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> but one way onely, that is, when he doeth ſinne with intention not to obey. And when he ſinneth againſt ſome Commandement of God, he ſinneth by ſome other ſin, and not <hi>by diſobedience,</hi> although in the committing of that ſinne, he is diſobedient to God. As for example: A thiefe is diſobedient to God, but this ſinne is <hi>by ſtealing,</hi> and not <hi>by diſobedience,</hi> vnleſſe he make it a formall acte <hi>of diſobedience:</hi> for then he ſinneth two wayes: one way <hi>by ſtealing,</hi> another way <hi>by diſobedience.</hi> As if a thiefe ſteale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will diſobey this commandement, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> he ſinneth both by theft, and by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and more by <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> then by theft. But if a thiefe ſteale, becauſe hee will ſteale, then although he commit a <hi>diſobedience,</hi> he ſinneth by ſtealing, and not by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and his act is not to be called an acte of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> but an acte of <hi>theft, quia ex fine morales actus ſpectem habent,</hi> ſaieth S. <hi>Tho. queſt. 105. ar. 1. ad. 1. becauſe moral actions take their nature of their end, for which they are done.</hi> And <hi>M. Champney</hi> did well define <hi>diſobedience</hi> when he ſaid, It was <hi>to reſiſt, contemne, or impugne the knowen commandement of a Superiour,</hi> and he defined it according to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> doctrine, who <hi>queſt. 104. ar. 2. ad. 1.</hi> affirmeth that, <hi>ad inobedientiam requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur, quod actualiter contemnat preceptum: To diſobedience it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that a man doe actually contemne the precept.</hi> But yet marke (ſaith the author of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> after that he hath cited a place out of S <hi>Thomas,</hi> which as I thinke ſhould be this, which I haue cited, and hee hath miſtaken the queſtion, and the ſentence) how <hi>Caietane</hi> doth explicate theſe words, (and in the margent he referreth his Reader to <hi>Caietanes Summe,</hi> as before) <hi>Idem est,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>contemptus praecepti, &amp; nolle ex intentione obedire prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto: It is the ſelfe ſame thing to contemne the precept of our</hi> Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:5209:111"/> 
                  <hi>as to haue intention not to obey his commandement.</hi> Firſt it is euident that <hi>Caietane</hi> doth not take any ſentence out of S. <hi>Tho.</hi> to explicate, but explicateth himſelfe according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which S. <hi>Tho.</hi> held of <hi>diſobedience.</hi> Secondly there is very deceitfull dealing in the tranſlation of <hi>Caietans</hi> wordes, where <hi>nolle ex intentione obedire,</hi> are conſtrued <hi>to haue intention not to obey,</hi> whereas the words imply a formall reſiſtance, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>to obey.</hi> And thus by degrees he would conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt that which is ſaid of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> as <hi>diſobedience.</hi> For in this manner he proceedeth. <hi>By which we ſee, that neither in this proper, and formall kind of</hi> diſobedience, <hi>is it needeful, that a man doe openly reſiſt, contemne, or impugne. But it is ſufficient that by one way or other, hee hath an intention not to doe that which is commanded; So that M.</hi> Champney <hi>teacheth vs very abſurdly, that no man diſobeyeth ſinfully, except he reſist, contemne, and impugne.</hi> See to what he hath brought this matter. <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> which hath hitherto according to S. <hi>Thom.</hi> bene taken for a ſinne, which doth containe an actuall contempt of precept, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no ſuch matter. But it is ſufficient for <hi>diſobedience</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and formally taken, that by one way or other, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der haue an intention, not to doe that which is commanded; and conſequently according to this doctrine of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mortall ſinne almoſt which a man committeth, muſt bee two double ſinnes, one in the kind, in which it is, as <hi>theft</hi> in ſtealing, <hi>murther</hi> in killing, and ſo foorth: and it muſt be <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> alſo formally taken: that is, as it is a ſpeciall vice, in that by one way or other, he muſt needes haue an intention, not to doe that which is commanded, to wit, to refraine from ſtealing and killing For this, ſaith the author of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> is ſufficient to make a proper and formall <hi>diſobedience,</hi> whether it be done <hi>in ſecret, or openly,</hi> which word I knowe not how he hath thruſt it in, or to what purpoſe, the doing a thing <hi>openly</hi> or <hi>not openly,</hi> being nothing to the nature of the ſinne, but to the ſcandall which may grow vpon an <hi>openly</hi> committed ſinne. So that not <hi>M. Champney</hi> (as hee concludeth) but himſelfe teacheth thus very abſurdly, and <hi>M. Champney</hi> doth according to S. <hi>Tho.</hi> teach vs, that <hi>to diſobey</hi> (not to <hi>ſteale</hi> or <hi>kill</hi>) <hi>is to reſist, contemne, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the knowen commandement of a Superiour.</hi>

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:5209:112"/>
               <p>The authour of the <hi>Apologie</hi> proceedeth to the other part of the definition which <hi>M. Champney</hi> gaue of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth it, to wit, <hi>That it muſt be a knowen precept,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concludeth, that it doth goe hard with the fact of prieſtes, but doth not ſhew how they did diſobey any <hi>knowen precept of any Superiour.</hi> He commendeth alſo the preuenting of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement, by obeying, which no doubt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: but if he inferre, that they doe ſinne who doe not obey, vntill they are commanded, he will teach an abſurd do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>And this is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>S. Tho. doctrine of this first kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> diſobedience, <hi>whereby let any man conſider the different ſpirit of S.</hi> Tho. <hi>about readie, willing, and ſimple obedience, from theſe our brethren, who in their firſt preface to the Reader, doe make a long ſpeech, that authority of Superiours, is not a ſure</hi> rule <hi>of trueth to be followed without examination &amp;c.</hi> What doe we here with any &amp;c? go on I pray you, and let vs heare out the ſentence if there be any ſuch ſentence there: but the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to ſtop this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from further falſifying the words cited out of the <hi>preface to the Reader.</hi> Can any man but this <hi>Apologie-maker,</hi> finde this ſentence there, <hi>that authority of Superiours is not a ſure rule of trueth to be followed without examination, &amp;c.</hi> as heere it is ſet downe in a different letter to deceiue the Reader? and in the margent there is this note to helpe it, <hi>A perilous and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous doctrine of our brethren about obedience.</hi> But becauſe this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low telleth his Reader, that he hath treated hereof before, in his ſecond chapter, I referre the Reader to the anſwere there made vnto it, here only repeating that which is there affirmed, and will be iuſtified; that whoſoeuer he is, that ſhall goe about to diſproue that doctrine which is there giuen of obedienee (as he calleth it) or of the faile which may be of trueth in a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, will prooue himſelfe an aſſe or an heretike. And the foundation at the which he immediatly after throweth his cap, to wit, <hi>that it is neither pietie, nor true obedience, at the firſt ſight to admit any authoritie, but ſuch as is orderly procured, and lawfully promulgated,</hi> is no whit weakened with this idle queſtion, <hi>Who ſhalbe iudge of this?</hi> For it is eaſily anſwered, that men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and learning may iudge, whether a thing bee <hi>orderly procured, and lawfully promulged:</hi> and the iudgement was giuen
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:5209:112"/> for the prieſts, who not truſting to their owne learning, ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> where their iudgement was confirmed, and hath ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beene determined by his Holineſſe, that howſoeuer it was <hi>procured,</hi> it was not <hi>promulged</hi> ſo as it bound the prieſts to obey it. Neither doth it therefore follow, that euery ſubiect is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his Superiours ordinances, nor is it abſurd, that men ſeeing cauſe why they ſhould doubt, ſhould ſeeke to helpe themſelues by dealing with their Superiour as the prieſts did, who preſently vpon the firſt knowledge of this authoritie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing what they did, ſent to Rome to his Holineſſe from whom it was ſaid to come: when contrary to the cuſtome and lawes of holy Church, it came without any his Holineſſe letters, as it is after confeſſed in this <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here he <hi>might alleage</hi> (he ſayth) <hi>the whole courſe of ancient ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers ſayings, about prompt, ready and ſimple obedience, moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contradictory to this vaine doctrine of theſe our brethren.</hi> But if he meane the vaine of doctrine which he ſayth is in the <hi>Preface to the reader,</hi> and is impugned by him as <hi>perillous and ſcandalous doctrine,</hi> then doubtleſſe he cannot bring the ſaying of any ancient holy Father againſt it, nor of any Catholique new father. If hee meane that the prieſtes doe argue againſt <hi>prompt and ready obedience,</hi> as a matter not worthy commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, he doeth but mocke his reader: for the prieſts doe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend it, as a moſt rare vertue. If he meane that the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient holy fathers</hi> did ſo highly commend <hi>prompt obedience,</hi> as they did condemne all delayes to obey the commandement of a <hi>Superior,</hi> vpon what cauſe ſoeuer, as ſinfull; hee is in a very groſſe error. For as wee haue before cited out of the chapter, <hi>Si quando de Reſcriptis,</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, writeth this to the Arbiſhop of <hi>Rauenna. Qualitatem negotij, pro quo tibi ſcribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, diligenter conſiderans, aut mandatum noſtrum reuerenter adim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas, aut per literas tuas, quare adimplere non poſsis, rationabilem cauſam pretendas, quia patienter ſuſtinebimus, ſi non feceris, quod pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua nobis fuerit inſinuatione ſuggeſtum. Hauing conſidered vpon that for which wee write vnto you, either with reuerence fulfill our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, or pretend ſome reaſonable cauſe, by your letters, why you cannot fulfill it. For we will beare it patiently if you ſhall not do that, which was ſuggeſted vnto vs with euill information or inſinuation.</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:5209:113"/> By which &amp; other ſuch authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would al the corrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cia</hi> be anſwered, if we ſhould agree, that the prieſts were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded any thing by a Superior, which they did not obey. But this can neuer be proued: for ſo ſoone as they did ſee his Hol letters, they did obey, as it is ſayd in the Popes owne letters, or <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>August</hi> 1601. And other Superior they know not, that could make an <hi>Archprieſt</hi> among them, with theſe appertenances. Whether then it be ſayd, that the Cardinal did it himſelfe, or that he ſayd the Pope did it, it is not greatly materiall. For if it be ſayd, that the Cardinal did it of himſelfe, wee aske by what authority? if you ſay by his owne: we ſay that he had none, or if he had, and had ſhewed it, he had bene obeyed. If it be ſaid that the Pope did it; we aske how this appeareth? If you ſay, by the Cardinals teſtimonie, we ſay it was not ſufficient to bind vnder ſinne to obey it. And this is proued by M. <hi>I.B.</hi> in <hi>The hope of peace</hi> pag. 32. and 33 and by M. <hi>Iohn Collington</hi> at large in his firſt reaſon: and by M.D. <hi>Ely</hi> in his <hi>notes vpon the Apologie,</hi> who handleth this queſtion from the 117. pag. to 233.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the <hi>Apologie. And all this now is about the first kinde of formall diſobedience wherein there muſt be ſome actuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with reflection: which is, as out of</hi> Caietane <hi>you haue heard, an intention not to obey: and would to God this alſo were not too o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſeene in this fact of</hi> our brethren, <hi>and their perſeuerance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> From this kinde then of <hi>diſobedience</hi> it was for the prieſts to purge themſelues, and from the imputation thereof. How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly then is M. <hi>Champney</hi> blamed, who to purge himſelfe of this kinde of <hi>diſobedience</hi> did firſt ſhew what this <hi>diſobedience</hi> is? Why is his doctrine carped at, when his aduerſaries are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay no leſſe then he ſayd? That <hi>diſobedience,</hi> as <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> or <hi>diſobedience,</hi> wherewith he was charged, did imply <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, reſiſtance or impugnation &amp;c.</hi> And to what end haue wee now a tale of <hi>a materiall diſobedience,</hi> which is onely commited by <hi>ſtealing,</hi> or <hi>coueting,</hi> or by ſuch like? Liſten I pray you to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtrange Lecture, which this <hi>Apologie-maker</hi> will giue you. <hi>But now beſides this (formall kind of diſobedience) there is another kind of materiall diſobedience, when a man leaueth to doe that which is commanded, not with intention, or reflection, hee will not obey, or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:5209:113"/> doth contemne his Superiour, but onely that he doeth either omit that which was commanded, or doe ſome other thing contrary thereunto. And in this kind is it to be preſumed, that the diſobedience of</hi> Adam, Achan, Saul, <hi>and others were.</hi> Wee doe commonly vnderſtand ſinnes of omiſſion, to be againſt affirmatiue precepts. It would therefore be explicated, what affirmatiue precepts were giuen to <hi>Adam, Achan,</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> or els this firſt kind of <hi>materiall diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> might haue been ſpared, it being no more proper to <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall diſobedience</hi> then <hi>to formall.</hi> And ſo doth <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia</hi> affirme of <hi>formal diſobedience.

Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter autem eiuſmodi in obedientia formalis</hi> per omiſſionem accidere poteſt &amp;c. altera inobedientia formalis eſt per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem: <hi>Formall diſobedience may often be committed by omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp;c. And the other formall diſobedience is by commiſsion.</hi> But to returne no more to this, It is euident that the commandement which God gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the apple, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement this author ſaith <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>ſimply diſobey,</hi> was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue precept in this maner: <hi>De ligno autem ſcientiae boni &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line comedas. Eate not of the tree of knowledge of good and euill.</hi> Likewiſe the commandement giuen to <hi>Achan</hi> was a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept. <hi>Vos autem cauete ne de hijs, quae precepta ſunt (vobis) quicquam contingatis. Take heede you touch not any of thoſe things which you are forbidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The precept likewiſe which <hi>Samuel</hi> gaue to <hi>Saul,</hi> was a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept: <hi>Non parcas ei, &amp; non concupiſcas ex rebus ipſius ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid: Spare them not</hi> (the Amalekites) <hi>neither couet any thing which is theirs.</hi> And conſequently theſe ſinnes were ſinnes of <hi>commiſsion,</hi> and not of <hi>omiſsion,</hi> vnleſſe we take omiſſion ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as it may include all the ſinnes in the world, for that by ſinning, a man omitteth to fulfil that which he is commanded. In which ſenſe, there is no ſinne, but there is an omiſſion, as a condition included in it: as <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Valentia</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall diſobedience</hi> in the place cited, <hi>Quae-materialis inobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia nihil aliudeſt, quàm tranſgreſsio cuiuſcun<expan>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> praecepti, in materia cuiuſuis virtutis, atque ita non diſtinguitur ab alijs peccatis, ſed est conditio quaedam generalis, incluſa in omnibus peccatis, hoc ipſo, quod peccatum omne eſt contra praeceptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Materiall diſobedience is nought elſe, but a tranſgreſsion of euery precept, in the ſubiect or matter of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:5209:114"/> euery vertue, inſomuch as it is not diſtinguiſhed from the other ſins, but is a certaine generall condition, included in all ſinnes, in that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſinne is againſt the commandement.</hi> Therefore although there be <hi>an omiſsion</hi> included in euery ſinne, and the ſinner may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid <hi>to haue omitted,</hi> as there is a <hi>diſobedience</hi> in euery ſinne, and the ſinner may be ſaid <hi>to haue diſobeyed,</hi> yet is he no more to be ſaid, to haue ſinned by <hi>omiſsion,</hi> then by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> but by doing this or that, for example, by <hi>theft,</hi> or <hi>murther,</hi> and ſuch like. This part then of <hi>materiall diſobedience,</hi> as our author cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, or as <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Valentia</hi> ſayth of <hi>formall diſobedience,</hi> is ſhewed, not to haue place in the ſinne of <hi>Adam, Achan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Saul:</hi> let vs ſee how handſomely their ſinnes will be deduced to the other branches of <hi>materiall diſobedience,</hi> which here this author ſpreadeth: <hi>or doe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſome other thing contrarie thereunto,</hi> that is, contrary to that which is commanded. Now we are to aske how, or in what ſort a man is ſaid <hi>to doe ſome other thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which hee is commanded.</hi> If a man be bidden to goe vpon the right hand, hee is properly ſaid to doe ſome other thing contrary to that hee is commanded, if he goe vpon the left hand; for it is another thing, and it is contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Likewiſe if a man be bidden to ſtand ſtill, and not mooue, if he doe runne, he doth ſome other thing contrary to the commandement: or if any other man can better explicate what it is, to doe ſome other thing contrary to a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will willingly learne of him. This authour then, when he would reduce the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> to this kind of <hi>materiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> who is <hi>to doe ſome other thing contrary to that which was commanded,</hi> in my vnderſtanding he knoweth not what he ſaith. <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded, that he ſhould not eate the apple: now I would know, what was <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience. This author, fol. 111. affirmeth, that <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>ſimply diſobey by eating the apple which was forbidden.</hi> But now what will hee ſay? for hee hath brought <hi>Adams</hi> offence in the roll of doing ſome other thing contrary to the commandement. And if <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a ſimple diſobedience by eating the apple, as he ſayth fol. 111. then was not <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne a <hi>materiall diſobedience</hi> in that kind which here he putteth, becauſe he did no other thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which was commaunded, but did the very ſame
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:5209:114"/> thing which he was commanded he ſhould not doe. Such like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the ſinne of <hi>Achan,</hi> who being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded not to touch any thing which belonged to the Amalekites, he did the very ſame thing which he was commanded he ſhould not doe: and ſo did <hi>Saul</hi> likewiſe the very ſame thing, which he was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to doe. So that the ſinnes of <hi>Adam, Achan,</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> were not <hi>materiall diſobedience,</hi> vnleſſe this authour can finde better meanes to prooue it, or to reduce them to ſome other braunch thereof, then here is ſpecified, to wit, that hee committeth a <hi>materiall diſobedience, who onely doeth either omit that which was commaunded, or doth ſome other thing contrary thereunto.</hi> And thus doeth he leaue the ſinnes of <hi>Adam, Achan,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and neither will haue them to be ſinnes of <hi>formall diſobedience,</hi> nor is able to ſhew, how they were ſinnes of <hi>materiall diſobedience.</hi> And yet he goeth on, and talketh, what diuines doe hold. Mary if you will haue this fellowes fauour, you muſt alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with S. <hi>Thomas</hi> before cited, that it is ſufficient <hi>the ſuperiors will doe appeare</hi> quocunque modo, <hi>by what meanes ſoeuer:</hi> that is, (according to this authors conceit) if you be told it, although it be in ſuch ſort, as you are not bound to giue any credit vnto it: which hath beene prooued very often to haue beene in our caſe, and alſo that by an inſufficient teſtimonie the will of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour cannot by any meanes appeare. And thus much in defence of M. <hi>Champneys</hi> definition of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> with which he and his fellowes were charged.</p>
               <p>The author of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> being (as it ſhould ſeeme) driuen to a deſperate point, beginneth to aduiſe the prieſts in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Well then, all this being preſuppoſed,</hi> (a hote piece of ſeruice) <hi>and all heate of partialitie and paſsion layd aſide, wee would aske our brethren in their conſciences before God, and as at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they will and muſt anſwere truly and ſincerely, when they had ſeene and read ouer Car.</hi> Caietans <hi>letters patent, wherein vnder his hand and ſeale, hee testified to them and the whole world, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the diuiſion and diſſenſion raiſed in England betweene prieſts and Ieſuits</hi> (I pray you bid the Ieſuites welcome into the liſtes, although they ſeeme to haue ſtolne in here at the latter ending of the fray) <hi>or prieſts and prieſts, vpon that or other cauſes, and for continuation of diſcipline, vnion, and concord, his Hol. had reſolued to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:5209:115"/> make a</hi> ſubordination, <hi>and had by a ſpeciall commandement enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame to him to be performed by his letters. And knowing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his Hol. not many moneths before (which the Card. repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his letters) had told the very ſame tale vnto diuers of them, at their departure from Rome, about theſe diuiſions, exhorting and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them most ſtraightly, to haue vnion and peace with all, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Societie, <hi>making the very like exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, which now the Cardinall did. All theſe things wee ſay concurring, and many others, as well letters from Rome, as men that came from thence, teſtifying this acte, and meaning of the Pope: and the very probabilitie and morall euidence it ſelfe, being ſo cleare, that no Card would euer dare preſume to doe, or attempt ſo publique an act vnder letters Patents, and that expreſly in the Popes name, without ſure commiſsion: Here wee ſay, let our brethren tell vs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and without paſsion, was this morall certainty of the Popes will or not, or was this ſufficient knowledge to binde, vnder ſinne to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or no? Was a Card.</hi> Protectors <hi>letters Patents, testifying his Hol. commaundement therein ynough to the condition required by S.</hi> Tho. vt ſuperioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voluntas quocunque modo innoteſcat, <hi>That our Superiors will doe any waies appeare? But we will not vrge this any further here, eſpecially ſeeing Fa.</hi> Valent. <hi>his doctrine ſet downe before out of S.</hi> Thomas, <hi>doeth most clearely conuince them. And therefore we leaue that to God, and their conſciences, to anſwere one day before the high Iudge, where ſhifts will haue no place.</hi> A condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I doubt not, but the author of this <hi>Apologie</hi> would gladly for this time ſhould be agreed vpon, howſoeuer when that day ſhalbe preſent, he would be willing to haue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the matter further deferred. For if we doe but reflect what meanes haue bene made, to haue it heard in this world, and haue bene croſſed by him, and his faction, we ſhall eaſily conceiue how vnwilling he will be to come to the triall in the next, where hee muſt come to the naked proofe of right, or wrong without his cloake, which now couereth all his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>To this adiuration the prieſts will anſwere in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences afore God, and at the day of Iudgement, where ſhifts wil haue no place, that when they had ſeene &amp; read ouer the Card. <hi>Caietanes</hi> letter, which he teſtified not to the whole world (as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:5209:115"/> here it is moſt falſly ſuggeſted) but onely to <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a letter written particulerly to him, and to no other (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the letter extant both in the bookes dedicated by the prieſts to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and at the beginning of <hi>M. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtons</hi> booke lately ſet forth) and written by one, who was not knowen to haue any authority in England, neither did he make it knowen, that he had any authoritie delegated vnto him for that which he had attempted but only by his owne bare words, which no man in this caſe was to beleeue vnder any ſin; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they had heard that his Hol. had giuen a charge to ſome in particuler, to haue peace with the Ieſuits (a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent matter, and as fooliſhly here vrged, for the band to accept the <hi>Subordination</hi> at the firſt comming) or had ſeene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letters teſtifying the ſame, as a heare-ſay (as <hi>M Colington</hi> doeth particulerly prooue, from the 68. page to the 80. or that he was a Cardinal who writ his letters (it being euident, in the opinion of the chiefeſt Cannoniſts, that a Card. may do more ſometime then needeth, or els they would neuer accord, that credit is not to be giuen to him vnleſſe he ſhew his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) whereupon <hi>your brethren</hi> doe anſwere <hi>ſincerely and without paſsion,</hi> that it was no <hi>morall certaintie of the Popes will,</hi> and that they had not <hi>ſufficient knowledge to bind vnder ſinne to obedience,</hi> and that no <hi>Superiours will did by any meanes appeare</hi> vnto them, but rather a very bad part of their aduerſaries to croſſe them for a time, vntill they could worke the Pope to confirme the plot which they had layde, to bring the prieſts into a ſlauiſh bondage vnder them: neither can they once be conuinced of the contrary, as may in part appeare by that their reaſons of their refuſall before the <hi>Breue</hi> came, doe ſtand firme as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered. And thus omitting to coniure the Ieſuits, &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt for their falſe dealings in this action, for which aſſuredly they muſt come to an vnpleaſing reckoning, I wil briefly touch what is here ſaid of the cenſure of <hi>Paris,</hi> and make an ende of this Chapter, referring the Reader for a larger ſatisfaction to M.D <hi>Elie his notes</hi> vpon the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Apologie</hi> pag. 245. and to <hi>M. Iohn Colington</hi> in his 4. reaſon pag. 153.</p>
               <p>The decree of the doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> conſiſted of two parts; the one was that the prieſts who deferred to admit of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:5209:116"/> the authoritie vpon the cauſes alledged, were not <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> the other was that the prieſts, (the fact of it ſelfe conſidered) did not any way offend, or commit ſinne. <hi>By this definition of Paris</hi> (ſaith this author <hi>fol. 118.</hi>) <hi>commeth very little reliefe vnto the prieſts, and it was printed onely to make a vaine flouriſh with the ostentation of an Academicall ſentence.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> ſticketh marueilouſly in this authours ſtomach, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. But let vs ſee how he will ſhew that this decree of theſe doctors did very little relieue the prieſts. To the firſt point that it was no <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> what ſaith he? marke I pray you his words <hi>fol. 115. for of the other point of ſchiſme we will not talke at all, &amp; am ſorie that euer it was mentioned, or brought in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But will you ſee this good ſope of milke turned downe with a foule paire of heeles? Note that which is behinde. <hi>Vnquiet people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken occaſion hereby to continue contention, and to make more brables, then were needfull.</hi> They were much to blame belike who would ſpeake being publiquely defamed for <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> and what els a quinteſſence of malice could deuiſe, as may be ſeene in the treatiſe of <hi>Schiſme</hi> written by the Ieſuits, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Archp. and yet to this day mainteined in corners, where any of that ſeditious crew can haue any hope to increaſe the <hi>ſchiſme</hi> (or diuiſion, or what els it may be hereafter called) in Gods Church by perſwading now ſome, now otherſome, not to communicate in Prayer, and Sacraments with thoſe who are the true members of Gods Church, &amp; for a cauſe in which theſe members doe in here, and plead the commandement of the head of the Church, againſt a priuate letter, from a priuate Cardinal to a priuate man, as may appeare by the letter it ſelfe. Were ſhame of that moſt wicked and ſenceleſſe ſlander, the cauſe of ſorrow or ſilence in this author, concerning this point of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> what hope might there be that he had ſome grace? but his ſorrow and ſilence grow both out of a ſplene, that his, and his fellowes ſlanderous tongues had not that ſucceſſe, which he and his froward malitious adherents hoped for.</p>
               <p>The ſubmiſſion which the prieſts did make at the ſight of his Holines firſt <hi>Breue</hi> of the 6. of <hi>April</hi> 1599. (acknowledged in his later <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1601.) conuinceth all but <hi>contentious,</hi> &amp; <hi>brablers,</hi> that the prieſts were further off by much
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:5209:116"/> from any touch, or any ſuſpition of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> then their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries here, euer ſince their firſt deuiding themſelues from them in prayer, and communion of Sacraments. But ſeeing he will ſay no more of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> we will omit it, and come to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which this author meaneth to handle. <hi>Our question</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is then onely, whether any ſinne were committed, whereof alſo we will not preſume to determine any degree of ſinne, but leaue that to God, and to the offenders conſciences.</hi> Now that the prieſts here be publiſhed for <hi>rebels, ſeditious, factious, excommunicate, irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, fallen from the Church, to haue loſt their faculties, ſcandalous, infamous perſons, no better then ſoothſayers, and Idolaters, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Church, and therefore as Ethnickes and Publicanes,</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this <hi>Apologie</hi> will not <hi>preſume to determine any degree of ſinne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Our queſtion</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is, whether any ſinne were committed:</hi> but he giueth no anſwere to this queſtion, but wrangleth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about the cenſure of <hi>Paris</hi> in this maner. Firſt, <hi>there was no man to enforme the Doctors for the Archpriest:</hi> As though the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors cenſure had not paſſed vpon thoſe informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, although no one of any ſide had been preſent.

But wil you heare him excel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who hath excelled the moſt proud, and temerarious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer in the world? Note that which he addeth, <hi>whether vpon true information, or otherwiſe</hi> the Sorboniſts haue ſpun a faire threed, when what informations ſoeuer be giuen vnto them, their cenſure is not to be regarded.</p>
               <p>The ſecond exception which this author ſeemeth to take, is <hi>that the Doctors did lightly paſſe it ouer, and defined the matter in the ſenior Bedels houſe,</hi> which ſuch as haue ſtudied in <hi>Paris,</hi> do know to be the vſuall place of their meeting, as ſtanding moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly for all thoſe, who are choſen to meete vpon all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, comming to the Vniuerſitie to be determined, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues not liuing in any one place, but ſcatteringly in the Citie: Religious men in their Couents; Paſtors in their pariſhes; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other Doctors in their ſeuerall houſes, or Colledges. How lightly they paſſed it ouer I know not, neither is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any ſuch difficultie in it ſelfe, that it ſhould aske great ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But it is an argument that they were not ouer careleſſe, what they ſayd, who commanded the <hi>Bedell</hi> to write it downe, as their definition in ſuch wiſe, as euery thing els doeth paſſe them, in their conſultations of greateſt matters.</p>
               <p>The third exception is, <hi>that it was giuen vpon ſome ſiniſtrous information: and that therefore the Doctors did prudently giue their cenſure in this maner: They committed no ſinne at all in that fact in it ſelfe conſidered.</hi> And that they added theſe words, <hi>for that they knew not what ſcandall, euill example, ſedition, and contention and hurt to the common cauſe had enſued thereof.</hi> Had this author in place of this word <hi>thereof</hi> put <hi>after,</hi> he had done more wiſely, as I thinke: for in that he vſeth this word <hi>thereof,</hi> either he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to be very ſottiſh, or els that the Vniuerſitie was very vnaduiſed in adding theſe words: <hi>that fact in it ſelfe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> for which words this author commendeth their wiſedom:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:5209:117"/> for if the fact in it ſelfe, were ſuch, as ſo much hurt did enſue <hi>thereof,</hi> how could the fact in it ſelfe be cleered from all ſinne? True it is that ſcandal followed <hi>after.</hi> But it yet remaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, that it enſued vpon the prieſts fact: doeth not much hurt come after much good? and ſhall we ſay that the harme enſued vpon the doing of the good, in ſuch ſenſe, as that the good which is done, muſt be a neceſſary cauſe of the euil, which had not perchance otherwiſe been? The fact then in it ſelfe conſidered being without ſinne, we are to ſeeke who ſowed the <hi>Zizania,</hi> which perchance had neuer been ſowed where it was, had not the husbandman ſowed good corne before.</p>
               <p>The prieſts perceiuing what was intended, and was likely to fall vpon them, if they ſought not ſome meanes to preuent it, ſent two of their brethren vnto his Holines, to preuent it if they might (for contrary to all cuſtom in Chriſtendome, there was a ſuperioritie challenged ouer all England and Scotland, as deriued from the Sea Apoſtolike, without any letters from the ſaid Sea for warrant thereof) and in the meane time the prieſts deferred their ſubmiſſion to the authoritie, as well vpon this cauſe as other contained in the information to the Doctors of <hi>Sorbon.</hi>

               <p>The Ieſuits and their faction (of which the Archprieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now become the head) were impatient of delay: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the prieſts did not ſubiect themſelues in this <hi>interim,</hi> but ſtayed their ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntill they did ſee the Popes letters, they firſt vſed their tongues, then their pennes, and both writ, and approoued ſeditious libels againſt the prieſts, tearming them therein <hi>Schiſmatikes, excommunicate perſons, irregular, fallen from the Church of God,</hi> and what not, that malice it ſelfe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe: from which ſlanders, while the Prieſts ſought to defend themſelues, great troubles haue riſen in England. Now then the queſtion muſt be, whether the Prieſts were the ſinfull cauſe of theſe contentions, by this their forbearance, to ſubiect them ſelues before they ſawe the Popes letters, or rather the Ieſuites and Archprieſt by thoſe their ſeditious and ſinnefull tongues, and libels? <hi>The fact of the Prieſts in it ſelfe conſidered,</hi> that is, their forbearance vpon ſuch cauſes, ſay the doctors, and <hi>prudently</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>was no ſinne at all,</hi> but the doctors were not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:5209:118"/> truly informed (ſayth this author) and therefore their ſentence was of no force.</p>
               <p>But what then were the defects in the information giuen to the doctors, through which the doctours are thought to haue erred in their ſentence? Forſooth, firſt <hi>the prieſts did not tell them, that the Card. was</hi> Protector <hi>of the nation.</hi> What if the prieſts did not know, that he was <hi>Protector of the nation,</hi> when his letters came into England, but onely <hi>Protector</hi> of the Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Rome, as his predeceſſour was intituled, and neuer knowen by any other title, as may appeare by the <hi>Bull</hi> of Pope <hi>Gregory 13.</hi> for the inſtitution of that Colledge, and the Theſis either in Philoſophie or Diuinitie, which were in the publike exerciſes dedicated vnto him? Moreouer, it is euident, that this which this Card. <hi>Protector</hi> did, hee did it by a delegation from his Hol. and not as a <hi>Protector,</hi> and therefore it had beene impertinent to haue ſaid, that he was <hi>Protector,</hi> and neither ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles doe multiply the perſon, nor any one perſon carrieth that credit, that in al like caſes he muſt be beleeued, except his Hol.</p>
               <p>The ſecond defect which this author findeth, was, <hi>that theſe doctors were not told, that the Card. did all this</hi> expreſſo mandato, <hi>by his Holines expreſſe commandement, which</hi> (ſayth this authour) <hi>the Card. ſetteth downe cleerely in his letters.</hi> To this I anſwere, that the Cardinall ſetteth downe ſuch words in his letters, but he ſetteth them downe onely in that place, where hee is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to labour or endeauour, that there ſhould be peace in all other places, as there was at that time in the Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Rome. And he that ſhould haue informed the doctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> that the Cardinals letters doe teſtifie either cleerely, as is here ſaid, or obſcurely, that <hi>he did all which here he did, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubordination or inſtitution of this Archpresbyterie,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſo mandato, <hi>by an expreſse commandement of his Hol.</hi> had ben <hi>ſimilis vobis mendax,</hi> and there had beene no trueth in him in this point.</p>
               <p>The third defect which this authour noteth, was, <hi>that they concealed another thing vttered alſo</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters.</hi> And what was that? to wit, <hi>that a</hi> ſubordination <hi>was demanded by prieſts letters to his Holines, and that his Hol. had allowed of their reaſons.</hi> To this I anſwere, as to the former,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:5209:118"/> that the Card. did not vtter this in his letters, as may appeare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the letters themſelues, but by this he giueth his reader to vnderſtand, what ſubſtantiall informations ſome agent for the Archprieſt ſhould haue giuen at <hi>Paris</hi> in his behalfe againſt the prieſts, and how ſhameleſly theſe and ſuch like would haue beene there vttered, which are without all ſhame ſet foorth in print for all poſteritie to ſee, that their ſureſt ancre by which they hold, is a graceleſſe boldneſſe to auerre any thing, and a blinding their adherents, that they ſhall not finde their falſe dealing.</p>
               <p>The fourth exception which this author taketh at the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is, that it was giuen, <hi>that many refuſed to ſubſcribe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were not the twentieth part.</hi> This difficultie we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate ſome Grammer boy to aſſoile, and to put it into the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> in what number may be <hi>many.</hi> But in the meane while, we ſhall conſider how the Ieſuites flattered with ſome, threatned other ſome, and yet were forced to preſume vpon others, and thereupon ſet others names to billes, without their conſent or priuitie. And if to this I ſhal ioyne the courſe which the Archprieſt tooke to compell men, to take him for their <hi>Superiour</hi> at the firſt, when he had no other warrant for it then a Cardinals priuate letter, and particularly directed to him onely (as may appeare by the letter it ſelfe) and compare this part of ſubſcribers, with thoſe whoſe vnreadineſſe in this action, was a ſufficient argument of their mindes, the number of the willing ſubſcribers will be found much fewer then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet was not the information giuen at <hi>Paris</hi> in any ſuch ſort, as this author enlargeth himſelfe, to wit, <hi>as though they had ben a great multitude, or the maior part,</hi> as the information it ſelfe doth ſhew. Neither did the Doctors cleare the prieſts, in any conſideration of <hi>multitude,</hi> but in conſideration <hi>of the fact in it ſelfe</hi> as appeareth in their decree, which conſideration depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not vpon <hi>how many,</hi> or how few, but vpon the lawfulneſſe of <hi>the fact it ſelfe.</hi> And whereas this authour addeth, <hi>that if the Prieſts haue encreaſed their number ſince, it hath bene by falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as this was to the Doctors of</hi> Sorbon, <hi>and by perſwading them to the participation of their libertie, and freedome from all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, which is a ſore bayte for young men, as all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:5209:119"/> If the Prieſts haue not encreaſed their number, or were not knowen (when this <hi>Apologie</hi> was written) to haue encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their number, how can he ſo peremptorily affirme, that <hi>thoſe, who refuſed to ſubſcribe</hi> at the firſt, <hi>were not the twentieth part</hi> ſo many, hauing ſet their hands to the appeale? And yet many more ſtanding firme with them, whoſe names are not there expreſſed, and yet are ſo many more, (if they knew how to liue in any reaſonable ſort, without holding with the Ieſuits and the Archprieſt in this controuerſie) as they would leaue a very poore <hi>many</hi> to ſtand againſt the Secular prieſts: Such the <hi>baytes</hi> are, and ſo vnpleaſant which are layd to drawe them to the prieſts ſide, as they haue no liſt to byte at them. The prieſts haue for Gods cauſe, put themſelues in ſuch ſtate of life, as they ſtand in neede of the charitie of Catholikes, who being abuſed by the Ieſuits and the Archprieſt, to diſfauour all ſuch as they diſlike, and to relieue onely thoſe, who ſhall ſtand with them: It is eaſily ſeene where the <hi>bayte</hi> is, at which a yong man will byte, beſides the infamie which is continually ſpread abroad againſt the Prieſts, that were it not, to betray God his Church, and their own ſoules, no doubt they had rather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues byte at the golden <hi>bayte,</hi> and worldly fauour which the Ieſuites and the Archprieſt doe lay, to catch young and olde, both of the Laytie and the Clergie, then at a cruſt, as ſome of them doe call it: and to liue ſo obſcurely as many of them do, yea and in great want, which pacience onely doth often ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply (a ſorry <hi>bayte for young men</hi>) as all the world doth knowe. And this is a ſilly diſpoſition to be perſwaded by any falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, eſpecially in ſuch matters, as of which they are themſelues eye-witneſſes, how they are handled, and cannot eaſily be deceiued.</p>
               <p>The fifth exception is againſt the <hi>information,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>that the prieſts refuſed onely to ſubſcribe to the authoritie of the Archprieſt, before he had obtained letters from the ſea apoſtolike for his confirmation: as who would ſay, that this being done, they ment to be quiet.</hi> This good fellow ſhould haue diſproued this and that, at the ſight of his Holineſſe <hi>Breue,</hi> of the 6. of <hi>April 1599</hi> all matters were not appeaſed, and that the Prieſts did not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this information giuen) ſubmit themſelues. But
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:5209:119"/> this he can neuer doe, for he will be diſproued by his Holineſſe himſelfe, who in his <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt. 1601.</hi> affirmeth it. And their behauiour in the meane time, was as became Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike prieſts, who had care to preſerue their credite, in ſuch ſort as they were bound to do, without perſwading any againſt the Popes ordination, or diſcrediting any letters of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> more then this, that they would not giue any ſuch credite vnto the <hi>Protector,</hi> that they would without his Holines letters ſubiect themſelues to an extraordinary ſuperioritie; to which without grieuous penalties, no Couent or Clergie are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect themſelues, as may appeare in that <hi>Extrauag</hi> of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the eight <hi>Iniunctum de electione,</hi> which is afterward extended by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third in his conſtitution which beginneth thus, <hi>Sanctiſsimus, &amp;c.</hi> to all Prelates. Although alſo in farre leſſer matters then this was, no Cardinall will challenge any ſuch prerogatiue to himſelfe, that his word or his letter ſhould ſtand for a law, to bind all men to whom the matter appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to yeeld their obedience <hi>vnder ſinne.</hi> And both falſly and fooliſhly it is here vrged, that it was the Popes ordination. Firſt becauſe the Cardinall affirmed in his letters, that it was his owne ordination, as may appeare in thoſe words of his letter, <hi>Dum haec noſtra ordinatio durauerit, ſo long as this our ordination ſhall endure.</hi> Secondly becauſe although his Holineſſe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it was done by his commandement, yet this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came not in a yeere after, and could giue no more notice to the Prieſts before that hee did any thing therein, then this authour of the <hi>Apologie</hi> hath knowledge at this preſent, by any leſſon which may be taught him a yeere hence, and yet cannot but thinke it great folly, to be charged for not beleeuing that, at this preſent, of which hee is not like to haue ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, any time theſe twelue moneths following. But now to the <hi>terrors</hi> which the prieſts are ſaid to haue caſt into Lay mens heads, of admitting ſorraine authority from the Pope: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that the prieſts did only caſt, as in wiſedome they might, whether it were conuenient for them vpon ſo ſmall a matter, as was a Cardinals letter, to incurre the penalties of ſuch lawes as were before of force among the Catholikes. For their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the <hi>Breue</hi> (ſo ſoone as they ſaw it) proued their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:5209:120"/> obedience, and reuerence to the Popes authoritie, which they are often, but falſely charged to haue reſiſted.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is, <hi>that the doctors were told, that it might be ſeene by the Card. letters, that the Archpriests authoritie was granted by falſe information;</hi> A point largely proued by the prieſts &amp; the place of the Cardinals letter, quoted in all their bookes, <hi>and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie was vſed in the choiſe of him and his aſsistants.</hi> Which clauſe this author hath ſet downe in ſuch ſort, as his reader muſt conceiue, that the prieſts had informed the doctors, how that this alſo might be ſeene in the Card. letters; which is a falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: for the prieſts did not informe the doctors, that any ſuch thing appeared in thoſe letters, but onely that they had noted that there was <hi>ſuch a partialitie vſed</hi> (as may appeare in their informations) without any relation to the Cardinals let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And no man can better iuſtifie this to the doctors to be true, then he to whom in preſence M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> tooke excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for wiſhing ſome matters were amended in the Ieſuits, and told him that it was the onely cauſe why hee miſſed an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceſhip. And <hi>F. Garnet</hi> diſſembled not the matter in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 11. of <hi>Nouember</hi> 1598. to <hi>M Collington;</hi> where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this concluſion about the middle of the letter, <hi>So that if they would haue themſelues, or others that doe not affect vs, (though otherwiſe ſeeming neuer ſo vertuous) to be choſen heads, let them firſt affect vs ſo farre, as in vertue they ought, that they may be worthy of gouernment.</hi> And at the beginning of this Chapter of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, fol. 99</hi> the principall counſellers in this action, are ſaid to haue bene <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> and <hi>F. Baldwin</hi> open Ieſuits, <hi>M. Iames Standiſh</hi> a ſecret Ieſuit, or one at the leaſt, who had promiſed to become a Ieſuit, <hi>M. Haddock,</hi> and <hi>M Martin Array,</hi> who hauing forſaken their courſe of life in the helpe of their countrey, lay to deferre ſome preferment by the Ieſuits their procurement, and haue ſince bene payde their hire, the one with the deanrie of <hi>Dullin,</hi> and the other with a prouoſtſhip in <hi>Spaine.</hi> And doth not this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme that which the prieſts did moſt iuſtly ſuſpect, to wit, <hi>partialitie in the choiſe of the Archpriest, and his aſsistants?</hi> The readines of the prieſts to obey (here againe obiected to haue bene a falſe information) is proued by the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1601. The matters concerning the two prieſts
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:5209:120"/> their iourney, their reſtraint, the iudgement of the two Card. againſt them, the breaking forth of theſe preſent troubles after the peace made, are to be handled in the Chapter following, and are here very impertinently brought by this author, as alſo that it was ſaid <hi>(God knoweth out of what office,)</hi> when ſpeech was of <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> his procuring the <hi>Breue</hi> of the 6. of <hi>April,</hi> which words, as it hath bene ſhewed, were no diſcredit to his Hol. <hi>Breue,</hi> it being acknowledged by the prieſts out of what <hi>office</hi> ſoeuer it was gotten, and the words imply no more, then that it might be gotten out of diuers <hi>offices,</hi> and that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> might vſe his talent, to haue matters ſet downe therein for his beſt aduantage, whereupon perchance it fel out, that the letters of the Cardinal were miſtaken in the <hi>Breue,</hi> as all the world may ſee, and it is particulerly ſaid where, in the booke dedicated to the <hi>Inquiſition pag. 59.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this exception, there is yet againe a refreſhing of the memory of the prieſts <hi>their pride and arrogantie,</hi> (for he draweth now to an ende of his queſtion which he propoſed <hi>fol. 115.</hi> to wit, <hi>whether any ſinne were committed by them, whereof</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>he will not preſume to determine any degree of ſinne) their making a dangerous diuiſion among Catholicks, in the ſight of the common enemie, and in time of perſecution, and would not be brought from it by authoritie, or gentle perſwaſions, whereof infinite hurts, ſcandals, and other damages, haue and doe dayly enſue.</hi> And if any man had propoſed the ſtate of the queſtion in this ſort, <hi>is it likely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſo learned, &amp; godly Catholicke men, would haue defined, that their fact had incurred no ſinne at all?</hi> Is not this a pretie reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the queſtion, which he had promiſed, pag 115. that is, <hi>whether any ſinne were committed by the priests their forbearance to yeeld their obedience, at the firſt ſight of the Card. his letter?</hi> I would aske this queſtion, when <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> himſelfe ſent firſt for <hi>M. Collington,</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke,</hi> and could not with all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, obtaine of them to ſay, that they did like of that which was done; what of all theſe matters here rehearſed by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, were then to be obiected againſt their fact? If anſwere be made, that afterward theſe things chanced, which would not haue chanced, had all ſubmitted themſelues at the firſt: This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is not to the matter: For we aske the queſtion of the fact
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:5209:121"/> in it ſelfe conſidered. And before theſe diuiſions among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks began, what was to be thought thereof? Will you heare this author his owne confeſſion in this place. <hi>And yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is their</hi> (the doctors of <hi>Paris</hi>) <hi>definition ſo limitted, that they determine onely of the fact in it ſelfe, and this alſo, according to the preſent information giuen them, excluding all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and conſiderations, that doe or may aggrauate the ſame.</hi> But what were theſe <hi>circumſtances, and conſiderations?</hi> Were they any other then the tumults which are here ſo often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated? If they were, let them be ſpecified, and they ſhalbe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered If they were not any other then theſe ſtirres, then how could theſe vitiate an acte before they were; the act in it ſelfe conſidered, was not vicious, but lawfull, (as here is auouched by the doctors) and lawfully done; and conſequently (to end this Chapter) all the euill which followed, was by the miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Archprieſt, and the buſines of his adherents the Ieſuits, and ſuch as ſtood with them, to defame the prieſts. And ſo for this matter, as the <hi>Apologie</hi> ſaith, <hi>We end.</hi>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:5209:121"/> it not haue needed any confirmation) hee beginneth his ninth Chapter in this manner. <hi>We haue ſhewed</hi> (a brazen face) <hi>in the former Chapter, with how great ſingularitie and little reaſon</hi> (and yet not one anſwered) <hi>our diſcontented brethren</hi> (not without iuſt cauſe) <hi>being ſo fewe, and ſuch as they were,</hi> yet ſo many, and ſuch, as their aduerſaries as yet neuer durſt aduenture to buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle with them in the matter in queſtion, holding it greater wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for them to keepe ſilence, then bewray their ignorance and folly, as this author hath aduentured in this <hi>Apologie, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues at the beginning to the firſt inſtitution of this</hi> hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, <hi>ordained by his Holines;</hi> a point often vrged, but neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, there being nothing but the Cardinals bare teſtimonie, and ſome heare-ſayes, which the prieſts haue ſhewed was not ſufficient, to prooue that it was the Popes ordinance. Beſides, (as it is ſaid) the Cardinall tooke it vpon himſelfe, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his letters: <hi>and againſt the whole body of our Engliſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, beſides themſelues, admitting the ſame,</hi> beleeuing the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of ſome that it was his Holines ordinance, not hauing ſeen themſelues the Cardinals letters, and being put in a fright to be excommunicated, if they would not yeeld themſelues. <hi>Now it remaineth to conſider with what reſolution and obſtinacie, they haue proſecuted this their diuiſion,</hi> (the prieſts affirme, that this is the Ieſuits <hi>diuiſion,</hi> and the faction adhering vnto them) <hi>notwithſtanding all the meanes vſed to diuert them from it, and quiet them, both by ſuperiours commandements, and friends perſwaſion.</hi> Theſe <hi>friends</hi> perchance were they, who diuulged them to be <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> and the ſuperiour commaunded them that they ſhould not defend themſelues, and their fame, (ſpecial meanes for quietneſſe.) <hi>And first of all, about this point is to be noted, that if our ſaid brethren had meant plainely and ſincerely (as often they doe profeſſe in the two firſt diſcourſes of their Engliſh booke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi> Copies of diſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c. and in their</hi> Information <hi>to the doctors of</hi> Paris, <hi>they doe auouch the ſame:) to wit, that their ſcruple was onely, whether this matter came from his Hol or no? And whether Card.</hi> Caiet. <hi>the</hi> Protector <hi>(abuſing the Popes name) had appointed it of himſelfe, and that they deferred only to concurre with the reſt of their brethren, vntill they might be acertained of this point.</hi> Well, good ſir, if all this had beene ſo, as ſo it was not,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:5209:122"/> but the prieſts profeſſions in the places cited, are either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or maliciouſly miſreported, as ſhall be ſhewed, <hi>It had bene a very eaſie matter to cleare the doubt by many wayes, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſending any to Rome, for that ſo publique an acte as this, vnder a Cardinals letters patents, might haue eaſily beene enquired of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meſſengers.</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould they haue inquired at Rome for the Cardinals <hi>letters,</hi> which they ſaw here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? <hi>patents,</hi> that is to ſay, priuat letters, directed to a priuate man, for ſo were the Cardinals: the prieſts had no doubt of the Cardinals good will, to further any deſigne of the Ieſuites, neither did they euer doubt, but that hee had inſtituted the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and therefore this was not the cauſe of their ſending to Rome, to be informed, whether the Cardinall had done any ſuch matter, for it was very credible, that he would haue done much more then he did (if he had knowen how) at the Ieſuites requeſt: but what were the other meanes? <hi>One letter of their owne either to his Holines himſelfe, or to Card.</hi> Adebrandino <hi>his nephew, or any acquaintance of theirs that was in Rome, might ſoone haue procured them a certificate of this matter, if they had bene deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue knowen the trueth; yea further, no man was there of the contrarie part it ſelfe, which in this behalfe would not haue endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to haue procured them ſatisfaction.</hi> Good natures, who would ſo friendly haue vſed the prieſts letters, &amp; yet did cauſe the prieſts to be caſt into priſon: and leſt that they ſhould haue miſſed of their purpoſe, they came themſelues with the <hi>Sbirri,</hi> but they were the chiefe captains, and apprehended them, and were their guard to their priſon: What if the Prieſts letters to his Hol. or his nephew, had miſcarried (as ordinarily it is omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to all ſuch letters as paſſe by the Poſt, and are ſuſpected not to be to the Ieſuits liking) might not his Holines haue bene induced to confirme the Cardinals acte, as a matter applauded by all the Prieſts in Englannd? <hi>If</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had meant plainely and ſincerely (as often they doe profeſſe in the two firſt diſcourſes of their Engliſh booke, entituled,</hi> Copies of diſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c. and in their</hi> Information <hi>to the Doctors of</hi> Paris, <hi>they do auouch the ſame; to wit, that their ſcruple was</hi> only, <hi>whether this matter came from his Holines or no, &amp;c.</hi> Hath this author too ſoone forgotten his paine and trauaile taken in the precedent
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:5209:122"/> Chapter, where hee brought diuers <hi>ſcruples</hi> by way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the proouing of the Prieſts their delay to be lawfull, of which fol. 110. this hee affirmeth: <hi>And theſe reaſons are ſet downe and printed in two of the first Treatiſes of the Engliſh booke, entituled,</hi> Copies of diſcourſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hath hee not ſpent paper and inke, and a great deale of fooliſh labour, in going about (fol. 116. to the end of the Chapter) to diſprooue, and cannot, the ſcruples which were ſuggeſted by the prieſts to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and will he now tell his reader, that the prieſts doe profeſſe, both in theſe Treatiſes, and in their Information to the doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>their ſcruple was</hi> onely, <hi>whether this matter came from his Holines or no?</hi> Is his memory ſo ſhort? or is his preſumption ſuch of the <hi>blind-obedient,</hi> that hee may ſay what he liſt, and contradict it at his pleaſure? yet with all theſe arguments to the contrary, the prieſts as well in theſe <hi>Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as in their <hi>Informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to the doctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> affirmed, that his Hol. commaundement lawfully made knowen vnto them, ſhould end the matter: which was no proofe, that they had no other ſcruple, but rather of their ready obedience to the Sea Apoſtolicke, notwithſtanding any difficulties, which did or might occurre, and were ſpecified in theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> and in the <hi>Information</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> and they performed it with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and charitie, by ſubmitting themſelues, and forgetting thoſe moſt impious ſlanders, which had beene ſpread againſt them of <hi>ſchiſme, &amp;c.</hi> by the Ieſuits, and had lien ſtill to this day in their graue, had not the Ieſuits raiſed them againe, and the Archprieſt giuen them free ſcope, to range in euery ſeditious mouth without controlment, and for the greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch ouerforward <hi>Amalekites,</hi> he publiſhed a <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which he ſaid he had from the <hi>mother Citie,</hi> that the refuſers of his authoritie were <hi>ſchiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then which this author affirmeth to haue been the <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſcruple of the prieſts their delay, being prooued not to haue been the <hi>onely</hi> ſcruple, but that there were many more, which this author took notice of in the places cited in the 8 chapter: it is euident, that the ſending of letters to Rome had litle auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the prieſts, the letters themſelues (if they had been deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Holineſſe hands) not being able to haue anſwered
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:5209:123"/> to the deuiſes of ſuch aduerſaries, as they had there found, and conſequently it was neceſſary, that ſome prieſts ſhould be ſent to deale with his Holineſſe in ſuch doubts, as they had, with this reſolution, that they would ſtand to whatſoeuer his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould iudge conuenient for the preſent. And in this maner did the two prieſts goe to Rome. And now followeth the ſtory of their apprehenſion there by the <hi>Ieſuites and Sbirri,</hi> and what chanced vnto them, while they were vnder the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ſafe keeping. And becauſe the blame of that which deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth blame, is layd to <hi>Fa. Parſons;</hi> as that <hi>they were impriſoned before they were heard,</hi> and ſuch like, this author to ſaue <hi>Fa Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> his ſides (of which, by his running ſo quickly out of the fire of perſecution in England, he knew <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> had a very great care) goeth about to proue, that the two prieſts, there impriſoned in Rome (before they were heard) <hi>did not proceede from Fa.</hi> Parſons; and if he had gone no further then this, hee might haue left the matter in ſome ſuſpence, and men might haue beaten their braines in conceiuing how ſuch an iniuſtice ſhould haue come into his Holineſſe head, but he will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>how it came,</hi> and thereby prooue that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> was no medler in it, to wit, <hi>that diuers did write to his Holineſſe against them,</hi> but alacke their writing, although it might haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what excuſed <hi>Fa Parſons:</hi> yet doeth it not ſhew that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> was cleare. Hee argueth, as though it had bene an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter for him to haue dealt in this action, becauſe ſo <hi>many other did write:</hi> but what if all theſe writers writ nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that point, with which <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> is charged; to wit: <hi>the impriſonment of the two prieſts before they were heard,</hi> to whom ſhall this fact be attributed? to his Holineſſe, who is knowen to be both of mild, and moſt religious diſpoſition, or to one of a cleane contrary ſpirit, but in that place, and credit, as he hath been truſted, both by his Holineſſe, and vſed by the Cardinall <hi>Caietane, Protector,</hi> as a chiefe director in all our Engliſh affairs? But of this there can be no doubt, but that <hi>many did write</hi> to ſome, or other, and thoſe letters were perchance ſhewed to the Pope, or els he heard ſomewhat of them. Let vs then examine this matter. The firſt place of the <hi>letter writers</hi> is giuen to his Holineſſe <hi>Nuntij in France and Flanders.</hi> But in this he hath not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:5209:123"/> done wiſely, they being both ſtrangers, and likely to haue had litle commerce with the Engliſh, eſpecially hee in <hi>France</hi> (if then there were any) and as for him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I am certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed from his owne mouth, that he neuer writ againſt theſe Prieſts, much leſſe would he ſuggeſt, that they were <hi>to bee impriſoned before they were heard,</hi> and be vſed, as ſhalbe declared. The next letters here mentioned (although not for ſuch as ſhould perſwade his Holines to that courſe, which was taken) were written by <hi>Fa. Bellarmine,</hi> wherein he certifieth <hi>Fa. Parſons,</hi> that his Holineſſe ſo greatly miſliked their troubleſome facte, that he had told him, that <hi>if they came to</hi> Ferrara <hi>hee would cauſe them to be impriſoned:</hi> who gaue theſe informations to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that without more adoe hee was reſolued to impriſon them, if they had come to <hi>Ferrara?</hi> If the memory of ſome, who read the letter, doe not extraordinarily faile them, this was an anſwere to <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> letter, which he had written to <hi>Fa. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> concerning the Prieſts comming towards the Pope: But yet there is a ſtarting hole left, and where is that? the letters of many of our nation, ſome of the <hi>principall,</hi> ſome of the moſt <hi>zealous,</hi> and herehence the Pope tooke his motiue <hi>to impriſon the priests.</hi> If this then be ſo, then muſt theſe letters be written at the leaſt, before that his Holines could by theſe writers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions determine, to caſt the two prieſtes in priſon, and yet not ſo long before, as it ſhould be impoſſible that the writers could vnderſtand of any ſuch attempts, againſt which they are ſayd to write, or to perſwade his Holines to this or that courſe in this or that matter, but neither of theſe chanced in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe. For all the letters (at the leaſt brought heere for proofe or inſtance) were written either after that his Hol. was induced to make this reſolution, or elſe ſo long before, as it was impoſſible the writers thereof ſhould haue knowledge of any ſuch attempt.</p>
               <p>The firſt in the ranke of writers is D. <hi>Stapleton, who</hi> (as this author thinketh) <hi>was dead before the two prieſts came into Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (he forgot himſelfe that he had ſayd <hi>fol. 120,</hi> that the prieſts came not into <hi>Flanders,</hi> but paſſed by <hi>France.</hi> But (alacke) the good mans memorie doth much faile him.) How then? what is to bee ſayd of him, and his opinion, concerning theſe two
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:5209:124"/> prieſts, and their attempts againſt the <hi>Subordination?</hi> and how was he one, vpon whoſe information, or inſtigation his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe reſolued <hi>to impriſon the two priests?</hi> marie ſir, you muſt goe looke in the 4. Chapter <hi>fol 40.</hi> a piece of a letter of D. <hi>Stapletons</hi> to <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> which was written the ſixt of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1597. but what doth, or can this concerne the prieſts comming to his Holines, toward the later end of the yeere 1598, to deale about a matter which was not before the 7 of <hi>March</hi> in the ſame yere 1598, as appeareth by the date of the Cardinals letter, <hi>Apologie ca. 8. fol. 104?</hi> There is alſo a piece of another letter of the ſame man to to the Cardinal <hi>Protector,</hi> of the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1598, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were written after that the <hi>Subordination</hi> was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it was written before that it was knowen in England: for (to our remembrance) we had no knowledge thereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was <hi>May</hi> here with vs. But howſoeuer this was, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that it could concerne the two prieſts their comming to his Holines, for this was not ſo ſuddenly determined in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, although vpon the firſt ſight of the Cardinals letter the Archprieſt was told, that there was iuſt cauſe for them, to goe to his Holineſſe. By this then it appeareth, that D. <hi>Stapletons</hi> letters, which were to <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> and to the <hi>Protector,</hi> could not induce his Holineſſe, <hi>to impriſon the two Prieſts,</hi> who came to deale about the <hi>Subordination.</hi> Let vs now ſee what the ſecond teſtimony auaileth him. This teſtimony was of <hi>principall men, who writ ſome moneths</hi> (ſaith this author <hi>fol. 124.</hi>) <hi>before theſe two meſſengers came ouer into Flanders</hi> (he ſayd France 120.) <hi>but their negotiations in England were heard of, and knowen,</hi> and theſe <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men</hi> (of whom the moſt <hi>principall</hi> ſtandeth for the prieſts, and is ioyned with them in affection, and action in Rome at this preſent) writ their letter to the general of the Ieſuites vpon this voice, which they heard, <hi>when you doe iuſtice, you ſhal make alſo peace,</hi> (a heauy ſaying for ſuch as will bee prooued to haue done as great an iniury as may be, by a publike diffamation of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and what not, againſt Catholike prieſts, without iuſt cauſe.) But what is this to the purpoſe? how was his Holineſſe vpon this letter reſolued <hi>to impriſon the two prieſts,</hi> who were in the way to him, for and concerning the <hi>Subordination</hi> which was made? the Generall perchance of the Ieſuits did ſhew this
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:5209:124"/> letter to his Holineſſe, and thereby the negotiations of theſe two, and their fellowes came alſo to be knowen to his Holines: all this goeth very currant. But what if thoſe men (now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>principall</hi>) neither heard of theſe 2. prieſts (as dealers in this action) nor of any other, not onely not in particular, but neither in general? What if they could not poſſibly heare, that there was any <hi>Subordination</hi> knowen in England, and much leſſe, that any did delay to admit thereof, when they writ this letter to the Generall of the Ieſuits? How ſhameleſſe will this author be iudged, who would bring theſe <hi>principall</hi> men their letters, as a motiue to his Holineſſe, <hi>to impriſon theſe two priests,</hi> before he would heare what they had to ſay? This <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was made at Rome the ſeuenth of <hi>March</hi> in the yere 1598, and if the meſſenger had ſtridden a blacke horſe to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yet could there not be any negotiations in England conueniently either by theſe two prieſts, or others concerning the ſame, in ſo ſhort a time, as that theſe 17 <hi>principall</hi> men (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were altogether attending, as it were to haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame meſſenger in Flanders) conſidered maturely of the negotiations, which were in England, could burniſh vp a letter, and diſpatch it vpon the eighteenth of <hi>March,</hi> in the ſame yeere 1598, as here is cited in the margent <hi>fol. 123.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now follow the letters of diuers <hi>zelous men. When</hi> (as this author ſaith) <hi>theſe meſſengers were in their way indeed</hi> for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were written, eſpecially thoſe of the 17. <hi>principall</hi> men, when the prieſts were in their negotiations, before they ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as it is ſaid <hi>fol. 124.</hi>) &amp; theſe men writ indeed very ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſuch confidence, as they might giue ſome ſuſpition to a wiſe man, that all was not well in England, but yet there is no perſwaſion to haue the meſſengers caſt into priſon, vntill they were heard: a duetie which they might challenge, if in no other reſpect, yet at leaſt for their trauaile in Gods Church, for which they deſerued a good opinion of the gouernours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The firſt here cited are from <hi>Doway</hi> 25. <hi>Octob. 1598.</hi> to the <hi>Protector;</hi> to which ſome haue acknowledged their error in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing. Theſe letters doe not cleare <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> for being the cauſe of his Holines reſolution <hi>to impriſon the two prieſts:</hi> for in this <hi>Apologie</hi> it is confeſſed <hi>fol. 120,</hi> that his Holines was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:5209:125"/> vpon the 17. of <hi>October</hi> 1398. to caſt them into priſon, for ſuch date doeth the letter beare, which <hi>F. Bellarmine</hi> (now Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal) is ſaid to haue written to <hi>Fa. Parſons,</hi> to informe <hi>him, that his Holines ſo greatly miſliked their troubleſome fact, that hee had told him, that if they came to</hi> Ferrara, <hi>he would cauſe them to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</hi> If theſe then of the 25. of <hi>Octob.</hi> came too late, to put ſuch a reſolution into his Holines head, what ſhall wee ſay of theſe which came after? for the next letters are from M. D. <hi>Worthington</hi> to the <hi>Protector,</hi> and theſe beare date the 30. of <hi>October</hi> from <hi>Bruxels.</hi> Next <hi>March</hi> D. <hi>Peerſe</hi> (who was the firſt in the ranke of the 17. <hi>principall</hi> men, but now God knoweth, what place he ſhall haue, and among whom, for that he is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the prieſts in Rome, and in that action) D. <hi>Caeſar Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that ſucceeded D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> in the office of aſſiſtance-ſhip to the <hi>Nuntius</hi> in Flanders, in all Engliſh affaires (a man that was neuer in England, but (to giue him his right) the fitteſt man for that purpoſe, as matters go, and worthy to ſucceed D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> or any farre greater man then he, in that kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Engliſh affaires) D. <hi>Richard Hall,</hi> three doctors, but what theſe, or other writ <hi>moſt earnestly, and grauely to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> as the other did, by al likelyhood this author knoweth not: <hi>For</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>he had not the copies of their letters,</hi> when he writ this <hi>Apologie,</hi> but hee met with a letter of <hi>M. Licentiat Wright,</hi> deane of <hi>Cortrac</hi> in Flanders to the <hi>Protector,</hi> which is here ſet downe in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> wherein this deane hath litle cauſe to thanke this author, who would diſcredit him ſo much, as to ſet downe his iudgement of two prieſts, whom he neuer ſaw. And although his letter doe exceed the limits of all modeſtie, yet doeth it not any whit auaile this author for proofe of that, for which it is brought, that is, that his Holines was thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, to <hi>impriſon the two priests:</hi> for this letter beareth date 10. <hi>Nouembris 1598.</hi> as appeareth here <hi>fol. 126,</hi> which was a faire while after his Holines had that reſolution, as appeareth by <hi>F. Bellarmine</hi> (now Card.) his letter of the 17. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1598. cited by this author <hi>fol. 120.</hi> yet goeth this fellow on very ſmoothly, and not without great applauſe of the <hi>blinde obedient</hi> in this maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and other letters that came to his Holines</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:5209:125"/> (as you muſt ſuppoſe) <hi>or to the</hi> Protector (he ſhold haue added, <hi>or to the generall of the Ieſuits, or to</hi> Fa.

For the Cardinal <hi>Burgeſius</hi> entertained them very friendly, and being certified vpon his earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt (ſet on by <hi>Fa. Parſons,</hi> to know it at that time) what was the cauſe of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Rome, he promiſed them according to their requeſt, to procure them audience, before they ſhould be iudged, which they did the more earneſtly requeſt, for that they had vnderſtood by <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> (who was then immediatly departed from the Cardinall, but was before certified, that the two prieſts attended his departure) that his Holines was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt them, &amp; nothing els paſſed betweene the Card. <hi>Burgeſius</hi> and them at that time, and after this they went to the Card. <hi>Caietan</hi> ſo ſoone as they could, after that they vnderſtood of his returne to the citie, and he was alſo very importunate, to know the cauſe of their comming to Rome, which when they diſcouered, hee ſeemed to be much troubled, eſpecially when they talked of the <hi>Subordination,</hi> as his fact: yet concluded thus with them, that they ſhould bring in writing what they had to ſay concerning the <hi>Subordination,</hi> &amp; the appurtenances to which they accorded, offering to haue the matter (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing properly to him) ordered by him (if ſo it could be)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5209:126"/> without troubling his Holines therewith, and requeſting his furtherance in ſuch other matters, as were onely in his Holines to graunt; And thus they departed with reſolution to returne to the Card. with their difficulties in writing, and agreed with one, who ſhould haue written for them the copy which they were to preſent to the Card. but they were intercepted by the <hi>Ieſuits and Sbirri,</hi> of which <hi>F. Parſons</hi> was <hi>the chiefe</hi> leader. And this was al which paſſed betweene the Card. <hi>Caietan</hi> and them, as the Card. well knoweth, and this was vpon the feaſt day of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, when the waters had begun to riſe in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which ouerflowed the citie, and vpon <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> his day, about the firſt or ſecond houre in the night, the two prieſts were caried away to priſon, perchance for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniſing of that feaſt in ſome reformed godly maner.</p>
               <p>This Authour hauing ſhewed (to ſuch as muſt not ſee) how that the Pope reſolued to impriſon the two Prieſts vppon the letters here cited: now he will peſwade (ſuch as muſt beleeue) that it was not poſſible, that <hi>Fa.

And although theſe Flanders men, who writ, were ſo perſwaded in conſcience to write as they did, and did therefore write, becauſe they were ſo perſwaded, this is no proofe, that they were not induced by others, to haue ſuch a conſcience to thinke or to write in that manner, and ſome of them haue acknowledged, and haue bene and are very ſory, that they ſuffered themſelues to be induced by D. <hi>Barret</hi> to ſubſcribe vnto that letter from <hi>Doway.</hi> So that this is a poore deuiſe, and a ſilly perſwaſion, that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> could not be the cauſe of the two prieſts their trouble, who was knowen to haue his Agents in all theſe partes, if himſelfe were aſhamed to haue his letters to be ſeene for any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it not being prooued out of any of theſe letters of Flanders, that any of theſe great perſonages (<hi>the</hi> Cardinal, <hi>the</hi> Generall <hi>of the Ieſuites, and Fa.</hi> Parſons) to whom theſe letters were ſent, were perſwaded by them that theſe two Prieſts were to be impriſoned, before they were heard, the authour leaueth the wound in <hi>Fa Parſons ſide,</hi> as wide as it was before, vnleſſe to heale vp that, he will wound his Holines much deeper, as who (being reputed for a moſt milde, and wiſe man) ſhould reſolue vpon the impriſonment of a couple of Catholike prieſts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as it were) bleeding from the campe of Gods Church, to open vnto him ſuch difficulties as were to be redreſſed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning their whole Church, or ſome members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who had lately challenged vnto them an extraordinary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie ouer their fellow labourers, without any warrant from him; and to open vnto him what perill might thereby come to the Catholike cauſe: and offering themſelues &amp; their cauſe with all ſubmiſſion to his Holines, as the effect alſo proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (whatſoeuer this ſlanderous Libeller ſuggeſteth to his <hi>blind obedient</hi> Reader) But this author ſheweth whatſoeuer he ſaith that he careth not, if his Holineſſe his ſides be pierced, ſo that he may keepe <hi>Fa.

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:5209:127"/> (ſaith this authour) <hi>there is extant a letter, written by F. Parſons to M.

A.</hi> as if M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> had bene the doer of it) was <hi>a Ieſuite,</hi> and that he put in and out what <hi>F.

Parſons</hi> he might (notwithſtanding the ſcoring of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and the after regiſtring (if it were regiſtred) ſhew what he liſted, and if their examinations be extant (as here it is ſaid) then will appeare in ſome of them many things blotted out, ſometime ſome words, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> cauſed to be writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which the priſoner deliuered; ſometime a whole queſtion, with ſome part of the anſwere thereto, when F. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> could not obtaine of the priſoner to make ſuch anſwere, as hee would haue him: for remedy whereof F. <hi>Parſons</hi> tooke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes afterward this courſe, that hee would neuer haue his queſtion written downe, vntill hee had heard what anſwer the priſoner would make, that if the anſwere were ſuch as he could wreſt it to his purpoſe, then ſhould the queſtion be ſet downe, and himſelfe would for breuities ſake frame the anſwere, about
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:5209:127"/> which there was diuers times ſome alteration about wordes, which the priſoner vſed not, but was often contented to let F. <hi>Parſons</hi> haue his will, when the words were ſuch as he knew he could interpret to good ſence, notwithſtanding his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors falſe intention, hoping alwayes, that hee ſhould haue ſo much fauour, when the matter ſhould grow to an iſſue. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that neither all the examination was euer taken, nor that which was taken, let to ſtand as it was taken, but ſomwhat was blotted out (as is ſaid) and many anſwers out off, vnder pretence ſometime of breuitie, ſometime that there ſhould be another Interrogatory, to which ſuch an anſwere would be more fit: the priſoners <hi>ſubſcribed,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſware,</hi> but to what? Not that there was al which was asked, or anſwered, nor that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had not dealt in this kinde, but that thoſe anſweres which were there made, were truely &amp; ſincerely giuen, which maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the clearing of F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> or the proouing of his honeſt dealing. And now you ſhall heare, what matters this author hath picked out of their examinations, and thereby perceiue, what this good fellow would ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt then, to talke of ſubſtantiall points</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>the examination of M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>beginning the 4. of</hi> Ianuary, <hi>and that of M.</hi> Biſhop <hi>the 10. of</hi> Ianuary <hi>1599, and paſsing ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demaunds, which theſe men call impertinent, they were asked, what was the cauſe and reaſon of their comming to Rome: who ſent them, &amp;c. To this M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>being firſt examined, anſwered in theſe words: Cauſa aduentus nostri haec fuit, vt rogaremus humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limè, &amp;c. The cauſe of our comming to Rome was this, that we might beſeech moſt humbly, and with all obedience the Sea Apoſtolicke, that this order appointed by Card.</hi> Caietan <hi>(for compoſing controuerſies in England, and to make peace) not beeing hitherto confirmed by his Holines (as we vnderſtood it is ſaid by diuers prieſts, and namely Fa.</hi> Sicklemore, <hi>and others) might be mitigated or changed, or ſome other order appointed with it for ſatisfaction of very many priests, who doe thinke (reſeruing notwithſtanding due honour to the Sea Apoſtolike) that by this way appointed onely, the ſtriſes begun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well be ended, &amp;c.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:5209:128"/> to be offended with me, if I went to Rome about this matter, and hee gaue me leaue to goe to deale for the change thereof.</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Apologie,</hi> by which it may appeare, what cauſe there was of the Prieſts ſo long trouble in Rome, their apprehenſion <hi>by Ieſuits, and Sbirri,</hi> vpon the feaſt of <hi>S.

               <p>By this alſo it may appeare, how iniuriouſly they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>ſchiſme, &amp;c.</hi> and with what wickedneſſe this matter was proſecuted in England againſt them. but to this depoſition, what ſayth this author? <hi>Thus he ſaid</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>which how true or probable, or coherent it is to that, which ſince they haue ſaid, done, and ſet forth in their bookes, I will leaue to the reader to iudge:</hi> and all the readers could neuer as yet find any particular, more then this author doeth, in which they haue bene contrary thereto: but how doth this anſwere ſuite with the reſt of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> which referreth the reader to the prieſts their bookes, to ſee what he would haue them vnderſtand, and yet hath hee taken ſuch order, as no man muſt read them?</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:5209:128"/>
               <p>The principall matters being then anſwered by this author in this maner, that the Reader may ſee, where he is forbidden to looke, he will anſwere to one point, or two in <hi>M. Charnocks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The one is where he ſaid, that the Archprieſt gaue him leaue to goe, which (ſaith he) the Archprieſt denieth, for that he ſaw no iuſt cauſe. <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> affirmeth it, and can put the Archprieſt in minde thereof, and of the cauſe that mooued him thereto: to wit, when <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> told him, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning himſelfe in that kinde, it were a neceſſary point of modeſtie, to giue leaue: vpon which he was bidden to goe, if he would; Neither doeth the Archprieſt his anſwere to <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> here cited, make any thing againſt this. For there paſſed ſome moneths betweene, in which ſpace he might alter his minde by the aduiſe of his priuie Counſell. Yet this much is here affirmed by <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> vnder his oath, that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite him: which is an argument, that it was not a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him, to bid <hi>M Charnocke</hi> goe, although no doubt he had rather they ſhould both haue ſtayed at home.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is, that <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> ſaid: <hi>Quam plures ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes, Very many priests were not ſatisfied with his Holines order.</hi> Where did <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> affirme this? Is it not poſſible for this fellow to deale truely in any one thing? Hath not <hi>M Charnocke</hi> expreſly called it <hi>An order appointed by the Cardinall</hi> Caietane, and muſt we now haue a tricke to couſen the Reader, &amp; make him beleeue that <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> ſhould ſay, that <hi>very many priests were not ſatisfied with his Holines order?</hi> But let vs ſee how like he is ſtill vnto himſelfe; <hi>which ſpeech of very many prieſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he doeth explicate afterward, what number it might import in particuler, being preſſed thereunto by an Interrogatorie in theſe words,</hi> Interrogatus, &amp;c. <hi>Being asked, what the number of prieſts now in England ſeemed vnto him, he anſwered, that he could not tell for certaine: but hee thought 300. more or leſſe. Then being asked, how many of theſe he did certainly know to approue this their miſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to be priuie to the matters that ſhould be propoſed, and would ſtand to thoſe things, that theſe two ſhould handle, and conclude in their names: He anſwered, I doe know for certaine 14. or 15, albeit I haue not had conference with them all my ſelfe.</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How faine would he play at ſome game, who ſtretcheth his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5209:129"/> point thus farre? <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> vſed theſe wordes, <hi>Very many prieſts,</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> declared what he ſaid to be true, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching the letters, which he brought with him: whereof ſome did teſtifie, that the prieſts thereabouts reſiding were of ſuch minde; other reſiding in other places, witneſſed aſmuch of the prieſts who paſſed by them. <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> remayning in a third place, could teſtiſie for the prieſts which were neere vnto him: and himſelfe remayning in a 4. place, could ſay ſomewhat concerning them that were there reſident. And thus was it explicated, how he ſaid, <hi>Quam plures ſacerdotes, very many prieſts.</hi> But now note, how this author would patch vp ſome matter. <hi>F. Parſons</hi> not being content with this anſwere, vrged <hi>M Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> as it is here confeſſed; <hi>how many he did certainely know to approue this their miſsion.</hi> To which <hi>M Charnocke</hi> (as I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) made this anſwere: that he would not depoſe vpon any certainty for more then thoſe, with whom he had talked, or had ſome particular meſſage, or notice from them, which were to ſuch a number. And this is that myſterie vnfolded, euen by the <hi>Apologie</hi> it ſelfe, how that <hi>very many</hi> might be ſaid to be of ſuch, or ſuch diſpoſition, and yet but few to be named, for whom, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine and proper knowledge, a man may depoſe; as the queſtion is here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed to haue bene asked. And in the ſame ſenſe is <hi>M. Biſhops</hi> anſwere here alſo acknowledged in theſe words, Puto me certè ſcire plus minus 12. <hi>I doe thinke, that I know for certaine 12. prieſts more or leſſe to be of our opinion and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to theſe matters.</hi> And beſides this changing of the caſe to a <hi>certaine</hi> knowledge, it is otherwiſe alſo altered. For the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not onely for, <hi>how many doe you</hi> certainly know? but for ſome particulers, which perchance were not neceſſary for all to talke vpon, who notwithſtanding might giue their full confent to haue matters altered from that they now were: and repoſed a truſt, aſwell in the meſſengers, as others who were priuie to all the circumſtances. So that notwithſtanding this oath that 14. or 15. were thus farre forward in the action, there might be the better part of the 300. who were ſaid not to be ſatisfied with this order (moſt falſly and fraudulently ſuggeſted here, to haue bene knowen to be his Holineſſe order) appointed by Cardinal <hi>Caietan,</hi> as <hi>M. Charnockes</hi> words are a little before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:5209:129"/> 
                  <hi>fol. 129.</hi> But yet there is an other proofe of the ſmall number of contradictors: and what is that? Mary ſir, <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> confeſſed <hi>that the first to his knowledge, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Archpr. called to conferre his new authoritie withall, was</hi> M. Collington <hi>and himſelfe,</hi> which anſwere is here both falfly and fraudulently ſaid to haue bene made to this interrogatory, <hi>who were the first beginners, abetters, and ſetters on in this contradiction againſt the Cardinals letters.</hi> It is very true that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> would ſometimes vſe theſe words: and the bauble that euery one of the <hi>blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> are ſtill playing withall, <hi>the faction.</hi> But againſt theſe did <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> alwayes except: and <hi>F. Parſons</hi> was to change his lewd termes before anſwere would be made. But how doeth this proue any thing to this authors purpoſe? Would he haue his Reader to thinke, that a matter firſt propoſed priuately at the courteſie of the propoſer (for his letters were to him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and not to the prieſts) to ſuch as he ſhould picke out for his purpoſe (ſuppoſe it were the moſt wicked thing that could be deuiſed) ſhould diſpleaſe, or could be contradicted by more, then were called, or ſooner then by the firſt that heard it? The marginall note I take as his cognizance to know him, and his fellowes: <hi>The first beginners</hi> (ſaith he in the margent) <hi>of this ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> M. Collington, <hi>and</hi> M. Charnocke <hi>by his owne confeſsion.</hi> He might better haue made this note in the margent, <hi>The firſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out of this moſt wicked, and ſeditious plot of the Ieſuits,</hi> M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, &amp;c. They (as is ſaid) were firſt called, and in poſt haſte they were ſent for, and <hi>M. Heburne</hi> to giue their liking. <hi>And we</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apologie</hi> repeating <hi>M Charnocks</hi> anſwere) <hi>hauing read the Card.</hi> Protectors <hi>letters, began to doubt not ſo much of the authoritie it ſelfe</hi> (that is, that the Cardinall had appointed ſuch a thing: for ſo doeth this <hi>Apologie</hi> confeſſe <hi>fol 129.</hi> that <hi>M. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> acknowledged this order, to haue bene appointed by Card. <hi>Caietane,</hi> neither do <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> his letters of the 20 of <hi>February</hi> cited, and abuſed by theſe fellowes, proue that after he thought any other, then that it was the Cardinals doing: Notwithſtanding that the Ieſuits laboured to haue him write, that it was the Popes order, and would ſometime make bold with this, where the law was in their owne hands) <hi>as of the good maner of procuring it.</hi> They perceiued that it was got by ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:5209:130"/> which is a ſufficient cauſe to except againſt it: wherby alſo it may appeare, how ignorantly this fellow cumbreth his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where he hath made this note, <hi>Ergo not doubting you are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to obey.</hi> For firſt M. <hi>Charn.</hi> doth not ſay, that they had no doubt of the authoritie it ſelfe, but <hi>that they doubted not ſo much of the authoritie it ſelfe, as of the good manner of procuring it.</hi> For they ſaw it euidently, that it was an ordinance of the Cardinall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand and ſeale, though in a priuate letter to <hi>M. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and his words were plaine: <hi>Dum haec noſtra ordinatio dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerit: ſo long as this ordinance ſhall endure.</hi> Yet knowing how this Cardinall was caried in our Engliſh affaires by the Ieſuites, it was neither fellony nor treaſon, to thinke hee might ſtretch himſelfe to pleaſure them. And if the matters had been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any indifferencie, doubtles neither theſe two, nor any other would euer haue called the matter in queſtion: but there being a notorious partiality deſcryed in this order, and ſuch as might be the ouerthrowe of our afflicted Church in England, the Prieſts had reaſon to make ſome ſtop at the firſt diſcouery thereof, as iuſtly they might haue done, although they had not doubted at al, but that it was ordained by his Holines appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by his Holineſſe letters, there being ſufficient cauſe to perſwade them, that it was gotten by ſurreption, which doth vitiate or make voyde his Holineſſe letters: as M. <hi>Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> proueth euidently in his firſt reaſon: and conſequently the prieſts were not bound to obey it: and the leſſe for that they prepared themſelues to goe to Rome to deale with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereabout; and in ſuch manner as is ſet downe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in this <hi>Apologie fol. 129.</hi> out of M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And the partiality which was vrged by M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> as iuſtly feared by M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> is declared euery where by the prieſts to be this: that the Ieſuites who were the chiefe head of ſedition and faction in England againſt the prieſts, were now become their iudges and executioners in the ſhape of a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prieſt, and no way ſubiect to any order, which was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue bene taken for peace betweene them &amp; the prieſts: and theſe to their iudgments ſeemed ſerious and graue cauſes, not to yeeld themſelues at the beginning: which their not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this authour tearmeth <hi>an oppoſition. Here we ſee</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5209:130"/> 
                  <hi>how ſerious and graue the cauſes were of this oppoſition at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and how at the first they did not doubt of the authoritie it ſelfe, nor of the Popes will therein, as after they haue pretended.</hi> Where is this ſeene? or where is any mention of any ſuch perſwaſion, that the Popes will was knowen therein, or that the prieſts did not doubt thereof? This fellow muſt needes borrow leaue now and then to play with his <hi>blind obedient,</hi> and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that they doe ſee that, which himſelfe doth not, nor can ſee: for in this anſwere of M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Pope, but onely the Cardinall <hi>Protectors</hi> letters, by which the authoritie was inſtituted by him, and might haue bene thought to haue bene authentically done (if he had any Commiſſion from his Holineſſe) or not authentically done (if he had none) ſo that no Commiſſion appearing, the prieſts might iuſtly doubt thereof, although not ſo much as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wit, <hi>the manner of procuring it,</hi> which they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue was by ſurreption. And for this cauſe M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſayd not, that they doubted not at all at the firſt of the authority it ſelfe, nor of the Popes will therein, as this authour doth moſt falſely ſuggeſt, but this onely, <hi>we hauing read the Cardinals</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors <hi>letters began to doubt, not ſo much of the authority it ſelfe, as of the good manner of procuring it,</hi> as in the ſame page this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour himſelfe ſetteth downe M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> anſwere. But yet note another ſlippery part of this fellow. He citeth M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nockes</hi> anſwere concerning what was done the firſt day, that the authority was made knowen vnto them, in which you ſee how he abuſeth his Reader, in proouing thereby the ſmalneſſe of the number of the prieſts. But he ceaſeth not here: for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in this manner, <hi>We ſee alſo, that the Prieſts could not bee many, nor of great account, that reſolued this embaſſage to Rome.</hi> And good ſir, how doe you ſee this? Forſooth M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſaid, that the chiefe prieſts that dealt with him and M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> were M. <hi>Collington, M. Cope, M Iohnſon, M. Monford,</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> and could not <hi>many</hi> be included in that word <hi>others,</hi> nor men <hi>of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</hi> if theſe that were named, were of no great account, were not this apparantly an odious maner of writing? I could retort the phraſe, and ſhew that ſome of theſe that are named, and others not named yet, comprehended in this word <hi>others,</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:5209:131"/> were ſuch as for their merit, and labours in Gods Church can hardly be matched by all the faction which is againſt them: but we will leaue this fellow tumbling in his owne dirt, and pleaſing himſelfe in his folly, howſoeuer he diſpleaſeth men of iudgement, who haue often difficulties, whether they may better lament him (who by this continuance therein giueth an earneſt peny, that others lamentations will nothing profite him) or laugh at him (whoſe folly is without meaſure, and ſtill proceedeth from folly to folly.) But now that he hath proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let his Reader ſee that they could not <hi>be many</hi> nor of <hi>great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> that reſolued of the embaſſage to Rome, he will prooue, that the <hi>miſsion and commiſsion was not authenticall,</hi> becauſe M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who was one of them that were ſent, affirmed that <hi>hee did not know, who was the first authour of this miſsion, nor why they two were choſen aboue the reſt for this miſsion:</hi> As though a matter might not be as lawfully taken in hand by one, who knoweth not who firſt did motion it, or why he was requeſted to it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then another, as by one who knoweth both the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and why he was imployed, yet his Reader muſt hereby perceiue, what authenticall miſſion, and commiſſion it was, and yet is there much bad dealing in the relation of M. <hi>Biſhops</hi> anſwere, as appeareth in a treatiſe ioyned to M.D. <hi>Ely</hi> his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie, fol. 13 But yet further</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſay a word or two of the very chiefe point of their commiſsion, and cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Rome, you haue heard, that M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>ſaith, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before, that their onely comming was to ſupplicate moſt humbly to the ſea Apoſtolike, &amp;c.</hi> he hath made his blind reader beleeue, that hee hath ſeene, and perceiued; now his Reader muſt in like ſort beleeue, that he hath heard; what? <hi>M. Charnocke ſay and ſweare that their onely comming was to ſupplicate, &amp;c.</hi> if his readers memory will ſerue him ſo farre, as to remember what he hath lately read, concerning this point, or turne backe ſome two or three leaues, he ſhal finde this word <hi>onely</hi> foyſted in by this authour, to make his Reader beleeue in the next page, fol. 133 that M <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> did ſcarce ſeeme agreed in the cauſes of their comming to Rome.</p>
               <p>After this boldneſſe, to abuſe his reader for his purpoſe, he ſayth a word or two of the very chiefe point of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:5209:131"/> &amp; cauſe of comming to Rome, which he thus abridgeth, <hi>to ſupplicate moſt humbly to the Sea Apoſtolike, that if the foreſayd or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Archprieſts authoritie, were not yet confirmed by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as they had heard Fa.</hi> Sicklemore, <hi>and ſome others had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that then the ſame might be either mitigated, or changed, or ſome other order appointed together with it.</hi> Thus hath hee layed downe the prieſts their plaine ſong; now marke what deſcant he hath made thereon: <hi>ſo as now</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>our brethren ſeemed not to doubt of the trueth or value of the Cardinals letters, nor were not yet growen to be ſo bold, as to affirme that his Holines could not do it without their conſents, except he violated the Canons; nor that it was aforreine Iuriſdiction ſubiect to treaſon, and</hi> Premunire, <hi>if it were acknowledged: and other ſuch like deuiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our brethren neuer grew to any ſuch boldnes (as he termeth it) as to affirme any thing of <hi>Treaſon, or Premunire,</hi> but onely ſhewed, that they had iuſt cauſe to forbeare to admit the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, both in regard that by the opinions of diuers men of Iudgement in the lawes of our countrey, this our caſe may and will be drawen within the Compaſe of an olde lawe, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> the law of <hi>Premunire,</hi> as it is ſet downe in the Engliſh booke pag. 6. where alſo is ſhewed, that by the accepting hereof the prieſts might be taken, for to comply with the chiefe authors thereof in al ſuch ſtate matters, as were practiſed by them. And theſe were rather cauſes for them, why they were not ouer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to admit of this authority, then arguments vrged againſt it: And yet neither of theſe cauſes haue or can be proued inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And for more proofe, that theſe cauſes were not giuen in any other ſort, the prieſts did ſubmit themſelues, when they did ſee his Holineſſe letters in confirmation thereof. But now let vs heare the firſt part of this mans deſcant. <hi>So as now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our brethren ſeemed not to doubt of the trueth, or value of the Cardinals letters, nor were not yet growen to be ſo bold, as to affirme, that his Holineſſe could not doe it without their conſents, except hee violated the canons.</hi> How doth this fellow vpon M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> anſwere gather this? If there were no doubt of the trueth, and value of the Cardinals letters, why is it here ſayd, that M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> put this doubt, <hi>if the foreſayd order of the Archprieſts au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were not yet confirmed by his Holineſſe?</hi> Did this ſpeach
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:5209:132"/> imply a doubt or no? if it did, how boldly doth this fellow deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant vpon a doubt, and ſay that it was no doubt? if it did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a doubt, let him tell vs, how a man may more properly make a doubt, then by this word <hi>if?</hi> Perchance he may meane, that the prieſts did not doubt, but that thoſe letters were the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters, and then he ſayth well: but he doth not deſcant right: for the queſtion was, whether that the Card. letters had receiued any force by his Hol. confirmation, as may appeare by that, which is here by himſelfe ſet downe: and whereas hee ſayth, that <hi>the prieſts were not ſo bolde, as to affirme at that time, that his Holineſſe could not doe it without their conſents, except hee violated the canons,</hi> the prieſts were bold to affirme (with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and reuerence to the Sea Apoſtolike) as much. But howe doth he proue, that <hi>they were not yet growne to that boldneſſe?</hi> Forſooth becauſe no ſuch matter was ſet downe in this point of M. <hi>Charnocks</hi> anſwere; as though euery thing muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be ſet downe, which the prieſts had to ſay, or could ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this is perchance an idle ſhift &amp; now deuiſed by the prieſts, and coyned for the purpoſe: Liſten then to that, which is ſet downe by this author in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to his Holineſſe paſt the middle thereof: <hi>Yet a fewe not the twentieth part of our Engliſh Clergie, and preſumed to impugne the ſame,</hi> (the Subordination) <hi>calling firſt in queſtion the ſayd Cardinals letters, their trueth, faith, and integritie, the indifferencie of his perſon in iudgement, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then alſo your Holineſſe meaning, yea your authority it ſelfe, whether you could doe it without them or no,</hi> (the canons of Holy Church obſerued) <hi>with other like vnſeemly oppoſitions for proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof they ſent two of their company to Rome.</hi> But this was forgotten when the author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> came to this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Furthermore it was obiected againſt the two prieſts at Rome, that they had there giuen out, that they doubted <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Holineſſe could appoint them a</hi> Superiour <hi>without their priuitie and conſent</hi> (obſeruing the lawes of holy Church) as may appeare by the libell Maſter Doctor <hi>Haddocke,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Martine Aray</hi> deliuered vp to his Holines (as was ſayd) 10. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1599: for there in the ſecond Article are theſe words: <hi>Ipſi verò nihil credere, nec acquieſcere, ſed haeſitare ad omnia, non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere authoritatem, vocare in dubium an vera eſſent, quae literis
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:5209:132"/> illis continebantur;</hi> Sanctiſſimi iuſſu hanc eſſe conſtitutam, <hi>&amp; ſi verum id erat, dubitare tamen, an pontifex facere poſsit, vt ipſis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſultis, ac inuitis, ſuperiorem ijs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtituerit, quod poſtea etiam quum Romam appulerunt dicere, ac ſaepius etiam repetere non ſunt veriti, vt per teſtes idoneos probare poſſumus.</hi> That is, <hi>but they</hi> (ſpeaking of M <hi>Collington</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi>) <hi>when the Archpriest firſt ſent for them, would beleeue nothing nor obey, but did ſticke at all things: they would not admit the authoritie: they called it in doubt, whether thoſe things were true, which were contained in theſe letters</hi> (of the Cardinals) <hi>namely,</hi> that the authoritie was conſtituted by his Hol. commandement: <hi>and if it were ſo, yet they doubted, whether his Hol. could appoint them a</hi> Superiour, <hi>vnwitting, and vnwilling thereto: which afterward they feared not to ſay, when they came to Rome, yea and repeated it often, as we can proue by conuenient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> And yet would this fellow perſwade his reader, that the prieſts did firſt contradict, or oppoſe themſelues againſt the authority, and then afterwards finde ſome reaſons for it, yea after the two prieſts were gone to Rome, notwithſtanding theſe plaine teſtimonies of his owne, that the prieſts had theſe difficulties at the beginning. But perchance M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere put all theſe things out of his memorie: <hi>&amp; non putarat,</hi> he thought not vpon it. How ſo? Forſooth M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſaid, that <hi>the cauſe of his comming was to ſupplicate moſt humbly to the Sea Apoſtolike, that if the aforeſayd order of the Archpriests autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie were not yet confirmed by his Holineſſe, as they had heard that Fa.</hi> Sicklemore, <hi>and ſome other had reported, that then the ſame might be either mitigated, or changed, or ſome other order appointed with it,</hi> thus he collecteth <hi>M. Charnocks</hi> anſwere: and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth with a, <hi>ſo as now our brethren ſeemed not to doubt &amp;c. nor were yet growne to be ſo bold, as to affirme that his holineſſe could not doe it without their conſents, except he violated the canons, &amp;c.</hi> The humble ſpirit of the prieſts (who hauing many and moſt iuſt cauſes to deale in other maner then by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication) being meaſured by his own proud humor of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling where he had no iuſt cauſe, brought him into this error. Next follow the reaſons or cauſes, which mooued <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> to come to Rome, which were ſixe, and hee here ſetteth them downe, and proueth that he, and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> did ſcarce ſeem
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:5209:133"/> to agree in the cauſes of their comming. And how ſo? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſayd, and ſware, <hi>that his onely comming</hi> was to ſupplicate &amp;c <hi>fol 132.</hi> But whoſoeuer will turne to M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocks</hi> oath ſet downe <hi>fol 129.</hi> ſhal find this iugler, and how that this word <hi>onely</hi> is here foiſted in by him for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo much</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>of this, for that it were ouerlong to run ouer all points</hi> (and not finde one for his purpoſe, without a litle of his arte, which will ſerue him no longer, then vntill it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the aire; for then all this painting and falſe colours will eaſily be deſcried, and himſelfe worthily laughed at, for his ſo groſſe counterfeiting:) <hi>yet this in briefe they affirmed both of them, that as for the Archprieſt, they brought nothing lawfully prooued againſt him, either in learning, life, or manners: and the like they affirmed of the Ieſuits.</hi> An euident argument euen to <hi>F. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and the reſt, that they went to Rome, to deale in peaceable manner with his Holines concerning theſe matters; beeing able to bring more matters vnder the hands of ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, then the Archprieſt will be euer able to anſwere, and which in any court of Iuſtice would haue hindered his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. But this authour ſetteth downe his matters ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warily: the prieſts brought nothing againſt the Archpr. <hi>lawfully proued</hi> (as for the Ieſuits, let any indifferent man iudge, whether the prieſts were in place to haue medled with them further, then that the Ieſuits were their <hi>Iaylours</hi>) ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like they could haue ſaid, but they brought nothing <hi>lawfully prooued: M. Biſhop</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſaid he heard his fellow Rob. ſay, that M.</hi> Collington <hi>and himſelfe had heard the Archprieſt vtter an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall propoſition: which was, that they could not appeale from him to Rome.</hi> They both affirme, that hee ſtood very peremptorily in it, after that hee was warned thereof: and if M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that this propoſition was <hi>hereticall,</hi> or the author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> doe thinke ſo of it himſelfe, I wonder that M. Biſhops <hi>fellow Rob.</hi> was not asked the queſtion, his examination not being ended in ſome 6. or 7. dayes after that M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, as appeareth here, fol. 134. and this is one ſpeciall matter which this author chuſe out of many, <hi>ouer which it had beene ouerlong to runne ouer.</hi> Will ye heare another <hi>in briefe,</hi> as he ſayth? M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> beeing asked, what money they had,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:5209:133"/> made anſwere, for 30. <hi>crownes</hi> more then M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: which perchance this author here inſerted, that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might giue credit to M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> when he ſaid, as is extant in the Engliſh booke, pa. 171. <hi>The examinations were: what is your name: how olde: where remained you in England: how and which way came you ouer: what money brought you ouer with you, &amp;c. and much ſuch like impertinent ſtuffe to fill vp the papers, that when wee came to the matter it ſelfe, they might be briefe, taking barely what we came about, without the reaſons &amp; perſwaſions of it: yea obiecting against it, and peruerting it what they could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third principal point which (notwithſtanding the haſt) was in no caſe to be ouerſlipped, but rather run ouer, is a <hi>diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> betweene M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> about one point of their commiſſion. And thus forgetting how he had before foiſted in this worde <hi>onely</hi> to make a diſagreement betweene them, in that the one ſhould ſay, <hi>that their onely comming was to ſupplicate, &amp;c. fol 132.</hi> and the other alledge <hi>ſixe cauſes</hi> of his comming: Now hee is contented, that M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſhould ſay, that he had <hi>diuers points in commiſsion:</hi> and how commeth this kindneſſe ouer him? forſooth he would faine find another diſagreement betwixt M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> and for this purpoſe, hee muſt intreat his reader to forget, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made him beleeue, how that he had heard, that M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> ſaid and ſware, that <hi>their onely comming was to ſupplicate, &amp;c.</hi> and now that it will pleaſe him to vnderſtand, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſaid, <hi>that he had in commiſsion amongst other points for to procure, that no bookes ſhould be hereafter written by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that might exaſperate the ſtate of England:</hi> M. <hi>Biſhop ſaid, that he liked not that commiſsion, but rather it ſhould be left as hitherto, to the diſcretion of the writers: adding further, that in his opinion ſuch bookes, as before had beene written, had rather done good then hurt.</hi> M. Doctor <hi>Ely</hi> hath noted vpon the <hi>Apologie,</hi> that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof is much troubled with the chincough: which in his relating this point, may be very eaſily ſeene, by his leauing out of certaine wordes at the end of the point, auouched by M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> to haue beene in his commiſſion. The words are theſe, <hi>ſine neceſsitate aut vtilitate: without need or profit:</hi> which words being added vnto the point (as he calleth it in M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocks</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:5209:134"/> commiſſion, or the petition of the prieſts, as they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it) maketh the matter ſo iuſt a requeſt, as no man of ſenſe can diſlike thereof. But the very thing indeed which troubled this author was, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> vrging very much to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the <hi>booke of ſucceſsion</hi> were not one of theſe, which were within the compaſſe of this petition, was told directly by M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> that it was, and thereupon grew a little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene them (to fill vp the papers perchance, as M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſayth) and as for M. Do. <hi>Biſhop</hi> it is ſo plainely ſet downe what hee anſwered concerning this <hi>booke of ſucceſsion,</hi> or <hi>titles,</hi> in the anſwere for M. Doct. <hi>Biſhop, fol. 16.</hi> (which anſwere is annexed to M. Doct. <hi>Ely</hi> his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie</hi>) that I cannot but wonder at this fellowes greedineſſe to forge matters, to make ſome ſhew at the leaſt, that M. Doctor <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> diſagreed. For firſt, M. Doct. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was not asked any queſtion concerning this point, as there it is affirmed, but had ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate talke concerning the <hi>bookes of titles.</hi> And the effect of his anſwere is, that the booke is ſo penned, as that while many by warrant thereof may iuſtly ſtriue for the crowne, a ſtranger may come in, and take it from them all: and how this agreeth to that which the <hi>Apologie</hi> ſayth, of a difference betwixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter D. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> an indifferent reader will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge.</p>
               <p>Now followeth a contemptible repetition of tickets and ſcrolles, the leaſt whereof was bigger, then any by which this <hi>ſubordination</hi> was requeſted (vnleſſe wee ſhould ſay, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Apologie</hi> would perſwade vs, <hi>cap. 8 fol. 98. &amp; 104.</hi> that the 7. of <hi>March</hi> endured at Rome vntill many moneths paſſed in other countreys) and many of them were directed to his Holines as humble ſupplications, to which according to the old faſhion men did not vſe to ſet any ſeale, but their names onely: and ſo were theſe ſubſcribed in the beſt manner, that the writers could, and the papers were of purpoſe ſo ſmall, for the better conueyance of them, if the bearers ſhould haue chanced to haue beene ſearched (as this authors wit might haue taught him) and not onely the names were to the petitions, but the matters which were demanded: by which theſe fooliſh doubts here made, are eaſily ſolued: <hi>what manner of commiſsion theſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:5209:134"/> men had, or could haue? from whome? by what meanes? for what matters? &amp; whether they in England would ſtand to all points which theſe men here ſhould conclude in their behalfe? and whether theſe mens authoritie were generall, or limited?</hi> For by theſe letters it was ſeene, that they had ſuch commiſſion as many could giue, where there was no one in authoritie; the Archprieſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet confirmed, nor (if hee had any) likely to haue giuen any commiſſion to any, whome he ſhould imagine liked not of ſuch his preferment. It was alſo ſeene, from whome they had the commiſſion, for that the prieſts names were to their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The meanes likewiſe were faire, without threatnings of execution and ſuch like, as were vſed to make the prieſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Archprieſt. The matters alſo were ſpecified in their petitions, and the prieſts in England committing their matters to theſe two, there needed no great doubt to haue bene made, whether <hi>they would haue ſtood to that, to which they had agreed in that behalfe,</hi> as they did, when (receiuing the <hi>Breue</hi> ſigned by their two handes, of which otherwiſe perchance there might haue bene ſome doubt, vnleſſe the originall had bene ſent) they all ſubmitted themſelues. It was alſo euident by the points ſet downe in particular, what they had to deale in, in the names of the reſt, although they were not thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred any way, to deale as they ſaw cauſe, or had hope to effect any good for their countrey. So that his endleſſe folly might haue bene left out, where he concludeth <hi>finally that the prieſts did onely agree in contradicting, and pulling downe, but nothing that was probable or facible for ſetting vp, and ſo their examinations were ended &amp;c.</hi> A very good concluſion, and well deducted out of his principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All this being done</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the whole proceſſe conſidered, and weighed well by the Cardinals, and after related to his Holines: it was reſolued, that the ſaid Cardinals, with his Holines Commiſſary</hi> Acariſius, <hi>ſhould goe to the Colledge themſelues, and to ſee whether they had any thing els to ſay, or write.</hi> Who doeth not now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to heare ſome matter to ſome purpoſe? For all which hitherto hath bene touched in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> ſeeme to be but <hi>praeludia,</hi> or an entrance to this acte. Here was it to be tried how iuſtly, or iniuſtly the prieſts had done, and to be ſhewed,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:5209:135"/> how worthily they had bene impriſoned with infamy, kept cloſe ſo long, debarred al helpe, one of the other. Here was the proper place for this author to haue anſwered the Engliſh booke, which was one of the two for which this <hi>Apologie</hi> was written (this apparance of the two prieſts before the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals being ſet downe ſo particularly in the Engliſh booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>The copies of the diſcourſes pag 95 96. 97. 98.</hi>) But alack the good man had not what to ſay, but that which would haue cleared the prieſts, nor was able to controll any part of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is made in the places cited, but turneth off his reader with certaine generall termes, to which he firſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him with as idle diſcourſes, Firſt taking occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime vpon D <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> for that he thought it requiſite, that <hi>the Archpresbyterſhip ſhould be recalled, as being neither requested by vs, nor any way profitable: and that ſome</hi> Hierarchie <hi>were inſtituted, which were to be approued by the free ſuffrages of the prieſts onely of the Seminaries.</hi> And for this this author exclameth, <hi>Loe what a reſolute lawmaker here is, who recalleth the Popes</hi> Subordinations <hi>in a word, &amp; ſetteth vp another of his owne making with as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie.</hi> Loe what a reſolute ly-maker here is, who affirmeth that which is moſt falſe, and can no way follow of the doctors words. For the Archpresbyterſhip was not the Popes <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> but the Cardinals, as then it was manifeſt by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals letters, where he ſaid, <hi>Dum haec noſtra ordinatio durauerit, ſo long as this our ordinance ſhall endure.</hi> Neither doeth the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in any place of thoſe letters affirme (as this reſolute ly-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker doeth often inculcate in this <hi>Apologie</hi>) that he did it <hi>expreſſo mandato Sanctiſsimi, By expreſse commandement of his Holines.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth the doctor <hi>recall</hi> it, but ſignifie vnto ſuch as were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rome, what his and others opinion was of the vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablenes thereof. And being thruſt vpon them vnasked, that it was to be recalled by his Holines, in whom the author (as I trow) will acknowledge a power to doe as much as this was.</p>
               <p>Loe likewiſe what a reſolute lye-maker here is, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the doctor <hi>ſetteth vp another</hi> Subordination <hi>of his owne making with as great facilitie,</hi> whereas the doctor writeth in the ſame kinde to haue ſome other by his Holines appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he deſireth not, that himſelfe ſhould be the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:5209:135"/> vp, but the prieſts whom it ſhall concerne, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording both to the Cannons of holy Church, and his Holines meaning, as diuers prieſts can witnes, the Pope hauing alwayes borne that ſpeciall fauour vnto the prieſts.

Is it not poſſible, that any thing did paſſe woorth the relating? was all this preparation fetched from <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> for no greater ſatisfaction, then to ſay, when it commeth to the chiefe point: <hi>that the meſſengers were heard, what they could ſay, or anſwere?</hi> If there hath beene

Watſons common wealth?</hi> In the Engliſh booke to which this <hi>Apologie</hi> pretendeth to anſwere, it is ſet downe pag. 97 and 98. that the meſſengers were not heard, what they could ſay or anſwere, and it is not ſet downe in general termes, but particularly, in what ſort they were not admitted, to ſay what they would, or to anſwere: to wit, that the Libell being read, the prieſts requeſted, that the Proctors might be put to their othes, that no falſhood was contained therein: and the Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> anſwered for the Proctors himſelfe, that it was not needfull, and furthermore affirming (for the poore dumbe men who as yet had not diſcouered themſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could ſpeake or no) <hi>that they ſhould prooue what was denied:</hi> the whole Libel was denyed, and a copy therof deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that anſwere might be made vnto it. This was it that the meſſengers did ſay, and the Ieſuites gaue this for one cauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, why the two prieſts were not ſet at libertie the ſame day, that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> had ſhewed too much earneſtneſſe in this very point, for which he was to be kept cloſe ſome two or three dayes more, and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> likewiſe: but yet for no other cauſe, then that it was not conuenient, that he ſhould be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, vntill the other had ſatisfied by a longer impriſonment, for his quickneſſe of ſpirit, in demanding the Libell to anſwere it. But the Proctors hauing before their leſſon, what they were to ſay, or doe, as it ſhould ſeeme, the one of them ſtepped pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently (without making his fellow acquainted therewith at that inſtant) betwene M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the table, whereat the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſate: and made humble requeſt, that the copie of this libell might not bee deliuered vnto the prieſts, but rather that a peaceable concluſion might be made. Of which the Cardinall taking preſent hold purſued that motion, and would not deliuer
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:5209:137"/> the Libell to the two meſſengers (whereby it is euident, that this authour followeth his old trade in this place, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, <hi>that the two meſſengers alſo were heard, what they could ſay, or anſwere</hi>) but ſhewed a good face to the prieſts, and vſed them ſo friendly as they expected not to returne to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſpecially being cleared from all matters by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, excepting this onely, that many were ſcandalized in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at their iourney to Rome: which was a thing, that they could not helpe, nor were iuſtly to be blamed therefore: yet notwithſtanding thinking it fit, to keepe the Cardinall in that good and friendly humour, the two prieſts made this anſwere: that if by their iourney to Rome, they had giuen cauſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to any, they were very fory for it, and were ready to giue ſatisfaction, and ſo were diſmiſſed, and all was well vntill the Cardinall <hi>Burgheſe</hi> was departed. But ſoone after his departure, the Ieſuite, who for this time had ſupplied <hi>F. Parſons</hi> (the head Iaylors) place, locked them vp againe in their ſeuerall priſons, but for two or three daies, as was pretended vpon the foreſayd cauſe: &amp; for that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> by his ſilence when he was bidden to ſpeak, after his examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> read, did diſcontent the Card. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. This author hauing told his reader of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Cardinals to the Colledge, and of the Proctors demand of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the new ſedition: alſo how that the meſſengers were heard ſay what they could (which as it is ſaid is moſt falſe) he concludeth this matter as if ſome great acte had bene made, and the Proctors had had ſome great day againſt the Prieſts. <hi>And finally</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>after diuers graue ſpeeches vſed by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals againſt this diuiſion in our nation, they departed, promiſing</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to F. <hi>Parſons</hi>) <hi>to relate all vnto his Holines, and to take his reſolution for the finall ſentence, which they ſent afterward ſealed and ſigned by their owne hands, and ſeuerall ſeales, bearing date the S. of</hi> April <hi>1599.</hi> (vpon which day in the morning the two prieſts their cloſe impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t firſt ceaſed) <hi>In which ſentence for that diuers things were inſerted in the narration, which might ſeem gricuous,</hi> (which were perchance according to F. <hi>Parſons</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, but not to be knowen abroad, leſt his doings ſhould haue ben known) <hi>&amp; the decree it ſelf, which is yet extant to be ſeen, appeared ſomewhat ſeuere,</hi> (againſt men who were not ſuffered to

And theſe places are ſaid to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the letter <hi>Interpretatiuely</hi> (for neither of them are named in the Letter) <hi>but not into England</hi> (he ſhould haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Scotland nor Ireland,</hi> for ſo runneth the ſentence) <hi>without ſpeciall licence of his Holines, or the</hi> Protector, <hi>vnder paine of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, and other cenſures, &amp;c.</hi> But wherefore was this ſentence giuen? True it is, that the two prieſts were baniſhed not onely their owne countrey, but Scotland alſo and Ireland, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in other countreys, where they were leſſe likely to haue wherewithall to maintaine them, and had not any thing giuen them to keepe them in theſe ſtrange countreys from begging or ſtaruing: (a bountiful conſideration of the Church, for ſo it muſt be taken, towards prieſts who had left their right and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of all preferments, to ſerue the Church with continuall and euident perill of their liues; and one of them had ſuffered impriſonment for the Catholike faith:) <hi>which ſentence</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>they accepted, and confirmed alſo by a corporall oath.</hi> This fellow forgetteth himſelfe: This ſentence he ſayth was by way of a letter (to F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who was Rector, or to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector) and by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> onely was this ſentence ſhewed firſt to M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> who was yet in priſon: then afterwards to M.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:5209:138"/> 
                  <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who was at liberty, and had ben ſo ſome certaine dayes. And neither did F. <hi>Parſons</hi> exact any oth of them, neither did they take any vnto him. And in the tenth Chapter, fol. 155. it is vrged, that this oath was exhibited, by <hi>the immediate Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or Delegate of his Holines,</hi> which titles belonged not to F. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> to whome this letter was directed by the two Cardinals, as ſhall hereafter appeare. The truth of this ſtory, and how this letter lay hid (as was pretended) in F. <hi>Parſons</hi> chamber, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes (as he told M. <hi>Charnocke</hi>) is ſet downe in the booke dedicated to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> pag 88. and it goeth vncontrolled and vntouched, which in the iudgement of any indifferent man it ſhould not, if any iuſt exceptions could be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt it. Yet muſt his Reader be told, that this author proceedeth no otherwiſe, then in ſuch ſort as muſt ſatisfie all men: for this he ſayth, fol. 126. ſpeaking of himſelfe, <hi>offering for proofe either the publique teſtimonies of his Holines, the two Cardinals</hi> Protectors, Acariſius <hi>the Popes Fiſcal, and other parties that were actors, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to the cauſe: or elſe the depoſitions of the ſaid meſſengers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vnder their hands and oaths: or finally the witneſse of the whole Engliſh Colledge and nation, that knowe what paſſed in this matter, which is another manner of proceeding, then to publiſh things in corners by way of libels, without any further ground of trueth, then the will or malice of the publiſher.</hi> But theſe teſtimonies ſo much vanted of, are loth to come to light, or are caried into ſome farre countreys, as diſdaining to be <hi>in corners,</hi> ſuch as <hi>England, Flanders France, and Italy:</hi> for theſe were the <hi>corners,</hi> in which the prieſts books were publiſhed: and in theſe <hi>corners</hi> haue the prieſts iuſtified their bookes, which this poore fellow calleth <hi>libels,</hi> to ſhift them off by one meanes or other. And the prieſts were neuer ſo daintie of their bookes, but that they who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues againſt them, might haue Gods plenty for their comfort: whereas contrarywiſe this miſerable <hi>Apologie,</hi> had a quartane euery time that it came to any of the prieſts hands: and when it was to be ſeene by them, it was by ſtealth, and but for an houre or two, ſo did it quake, for feare of being found to be ſuch ſtuffe, as ſince it hath bene ſufficiently diſcouered. Yet to encourage the <hi>blind-obedient,</hi> it telleth them of <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Cardinals teſtimonies,</hi> and <hi>authenticall matters,</hi> and bringeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:5209:139"/> which can pleaſe theſe blinde affectioned, but ſome rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words againſt Catholike prieſts, as though if it could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the reader, that they were moſt wicked by often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it vnto him, the cauſe were wonne: and a railing word of this authors mouth, would be of more weight to determine a controuerſie, then all poſſible right in the part oppreſſed. But the indifferent reader will weigh his reaſons, and not his foule words; and iudge of matters, not as they are ſaid to be, but as they are prooued.

               <p>
                  <hi>After that his Hol. had well conſidered the little waight of reaſon, which theſe two former meſſengers had brought in the behalfe of their partners in England, for raiſing ſo great a ſedition againſt the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors <hi>letters, and Archprieſts incitation, and had giuen ſome due reprehenſion to the ſayd meſſengers, as by their reſtraint, aſwell in Rome, as by that they were not permitted to returne preſently into England, he thought conuenient to confirme the ſayd</hi> Protectors <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp;c.</hi> In theſe few lines it is to be noted firſt, how that his Holineſſe is ſayd to haue reſtrained the prieſts (who went to Rome) vpon conſideration of <hi>the little waight of reaſon,</hi> which they brought, and permitted them not to returne, or (as we ſay
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:5209:139"/> in Engliſh) <hi>baniſhed them,</hi> not onely <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo, and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yea and <hi>confined them</hi> to ſeuerall Countreys, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing them any thing for their maintenance. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how his Holineſſe confirmed the Cardinals letters. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt, it is knowen to all the world, or at the leaſt in thoſe parts, which this author calleth <hi>corners,</hi> thoſe are <hi>England, Flanders, France,</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> where their bookes haue been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, or ſent, that the two prieſts were reſtrained before they deliuered any reaſons of their forbearance, to ſubiect themſelues to the Archprieſt, and as yet no one part of their relation hath been prooued faulty. They haue layd downe an orderly narration of their meſſengers diſorderly reſtraint, through the falſe &amp; wicked ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their aduerſaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they had any audience, and thereby haue made it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that his Holines did not reſtraine them, vpon any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their reaſons, becauſe he heard them not, nor any cauſe elſe, before they were reſtrained. Secondly, it is at large related both in the Engliſh booke pag. 97.98.104.105. and els where, as alſo in the booke to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> pag 77. how that when the prieſts came to their anſwere, before the Cardinals <hi>Caietane,</hi> and <hi>Burgheſe,</hi> they were not ſuffered to haue a copie of their accuſations brought againſt them, (although it were moſt earneſtly demanded by them) that they might make their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thereunto, but a diſſembling ſhew was made to haue all matters taken vp in peace and quietnes. And this author not being able to gaineſay any of this: how ſhameleſly doth he here tell his reader, that <hi>his Holineſſe had well conſidered the little weight of their reaſons:</hi> and had therefore not onely reſtrained them, but <hi>baniſhed them,</hi> or (as he tearmeth it) not permitted them to returne preſently into England? And although it be true which this author affirmeth, that his Holines confirmed the Card. letters: yet it is euident, that he did not vpon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>the little weight</hi> of the meſſengers <hi>their reaſons:</hi> for they were neuer ſuffred to deliuer them, as the cuſtome of God Church was, where a matter is inſtituted, and ſome doe offer themſelues (to thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it belongeth) to ſhew what they haue to ſay in it, before it be eſtabliſhed. Neither hath this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhewed, or can without a tricke of his accuſtomed falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:5209:140"/> ſay, that the two prieſts euer appeared in this action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other, then thoſe two Cardinals, vpon the 17. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1599. or that they did not at that time make requeſt, to haue the copie of the <hi>Libel,</hi> to make their anſwere vnto it. And as for their examinations, who is ſo ſimple, as to build any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereon, as though that were a place, or time conuenient for them to deale in the charge committed vnto them, being both aſunder, and priuatly talked with, or examined by their profeſſed enemies? The time, and place of triall was before the appointed Iudges: when, and where this author muſt ſhewe, that they did not offer to make their anſwere to whatſoeuer was obiected againſt them: and namely to that abſurd Libel, which M D. <hi>Haddock,</hi> and M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> put vp againſt them concerning a <hi>ſedition</hi> (as the <hi>Libel</hi> tearmeth it) ſuppoſed to haue bene raiſed in England by them, and their fellowes, by not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the authority vpon the ſight of the Cardinals letters. Here was this author to haue ſhewed a defect of the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers their reaſons, and not to haue ouerſlipped theſe partieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which paſſed in this time and place, being the ſole time and place, in which the two meſſengers met, &amp; might haue ſhewed their reaſons, if they might haue been heard. But this author his faireſt game is to ſlubber vp al material points, and to beare his reader in hand in generall tearmes, with teſtimonies <hi>of Popes</hi> and <hi>Cardinals;</hi> which indeed he bringeth ſome time, but not at all for the matter, in which he ought to bring his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, or to controll any thing, which is ſet downe by the prieſt. And ſo doth he bring here an <hi>authenticall teſtimony,</hi> that his Holines confirmed the Cardinals letters. But he prooueth not thereby that the prieſts reſtraint and baniſhment were iuſt. But let vs examine this teſtimony, which is here brought: and wee ſhall finde a notorious falſifying of the Popes letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> (the Pope) <hi>thought conuenient, to confirme the ſayd</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>letters, and euery part and parcel thereof, with a new</hi> Breue, <hi>dated the ſixt of</hi> April <hi>1599. Affirming.</hi> omnia, &amp; ſingula de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſo mandato, &amp; ordine, &amp; cum participatione, &amp; certa ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia noſtris, facta, &amp; ordinata fuiſſe, &amp; eſſe. <hi>That all and euery thing contained in the ſame letters were done and ordayned by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe expreſse commandement and order, and by his certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:5209:140"/> and participation.</hi> All this is truely related out of the <hi>Breue.</hi> And had he here made a ſtop, he might haue been accounted an idle fellow, to cite a matter, of which not one word proued any thing at all, that the little waight of their reaſons, was a cauſe of the prieſts <hi>reſtraint</hi> in Rome, <hi>confinement</hi> in ſtrange Countreys, or <hi>confirmation</hi> of the authoritie. But he will goe a little further; and becauſe if he had cited the <hi>Latine,</hi> he ſhould haue diſcouered his falſhood, he maketh a ſtop thereat, and goeth forward with an Engliſh tranſlation of the <hi>Brene</hi> in this manner: <hi>And therefore to haue been and to bee firme, and in force and of moſt full validitie, &amp;c and ſo to bee taken, and executed of all men &amp;c.</hi> which couple of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an argument that he went on forward citing the <hi>Breue</hi> for his purpoſe, but how honeſtly, let euery man iudge, the Latine being in this maner: <hi>Ac propte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, valida, firma, &amp; efficacia exiſtere, &amp; fore &amp;c. decernimus. We decree therefore, that now</hi> (vpon this confirmation) <hi>they bee, and ſhalbe of force firme, and of efficacie.</hi> And who is ſo blinde, that doth not ſee whether he will or no, that theſe words here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by this author <hi>to haue bene,</hi> are falſly thruſt in by him, to couſin his reader, and to haue him beleeue, that his Holineſſe declared in this <hi>Breue,</hi> that all things were of force by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letters: which beſides the moſt groſſe impoſture is moſt abſurd, and againſt all law and reaſon, as is euery where ſhewed (the letters being no other, then from a Cardinall for the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a very great authority giuen by him without ſhewing any commiſſion from his Holines, by which he might doe it.) But there is no dealing for this Author, if hee ſhould deale ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in any one matter, concerning the queſtion in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie. But the Archprieſt hath preſumed to goe a litle further, in adding theſe words, <hi>ab initio.</hi> And in this Edict againſt the cenſure of <hi>Paris,</hi> he telleth his ſubiects, that the Pope had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Cardinals letters, as <hi>validas ab initio, to haue beene of force from the beginning,</hi> which if they could beate into the cares of the <hi>blind-obedient,</hi> it is as much as they deſire. For they haue taken from their ſight the view of all bookes, wherein they might diſcouer how falſly they are lead, and perſwaded by guides blinder then themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This declaration</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and confirmation of his Holines, when
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:5209:141"/> it came foorth, euery man was of opinion, that all queſtions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies would be ended thereby: ſeeing that nothing was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before by the</hi> troubleſome (ſo pleaſeth it this foule mouthed fellow to tearme the Prieſts) <hi>but only to haue certaine intelligence of his Holineſſe will and meaning.</hi> Doubtleſſe all that meant wel and honeſtly, thought that here would haue been an end of all controuerſies, not becauſe the prieſts pretended nothing els, then to know his Holineſſe will, for this author knoweth the contrary, but yet muſt ſay ſomewhat, although contrary to his owne knowledge, manifeſted in the 8 chapter of the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, fol. 107.108.110.</hi> where he pretendeth to giue ſatisfaction to the reaſons alleaged by the prieſts, before this <hi>Breue</hi> was made, but becauſe the prieſts did alwayes offer (which alſo they perfourmed) that ſo ſoone as they ſhould ſee any <hi>Breue</hi> in confirmation of this authoritie, they would yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, notwithſtanding the reaſons which they had to the contrary. But this fellow imagineth, that vnleſſe he practiſeth his trade of lying almoſt in euery line, he ſhall loſe that habit, which hath, &amp; muſt get him all the credit which he looketh for. The prieſts gaue their words both in England, &amp; in Rome (by them whom they ſent thither) that al ſhould be quiet vpon the ſight of the <hi>Breue.</hi> But the Ieſuites and Archprieſt did not giue their words, that the peace ſhould endure. And thereupon was the peace broken, and not by the Prieſts, as is ſet downe in al theſe bookes of the Prieſtes, and as yet neither is, nor can bee diſprooued by this Authour, who heere vndertaketh an anſwere vnto them. I omitte the kindeneſſe, which was offered vnto the two prieſts by <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> it is ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in the bookes already ſet forth. The Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke nation in Rome, here ſpoken of, vſed them indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what kindly, and friendly in all points to their power: but not for loue of the Ieſuits, but vpon their owne honeſt diſpoſitions: except it be meant by M. D. <hi>Haddock,</hi> and <hi>M. Martin Array,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe lodging the two prieſts were ſent: the one vpon the 22. of <hi>April,</hi> (for then he was ſet at libertie, and not preſently vpon their ſight of the <hi>Breue,</hi> or aſſurance that all would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues, for this was done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 8 or 9. of <hi>April,</hi> when <hi>F. Parſons</hi> did firſt bring them the <hi>Breue</hi> to copy it out,) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:5209:141"/> vpon the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> (for then, and not before was the other at libertie, &amp; not preſently vpon their aſſurance that all would be quiet, as here it is moſt falſly ſuggeſted.) And the trueth is, that this doctor, and his fellow Proctor did vſe that kindneſſe towards the two prieſts, as euery day when the prieſts went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the doctor himſelfe or his felow Proctor would take the paines to rig vp their chamber, that no looſe paper ſhould be loſt, which they might by any chance leaue behinde them. There was alſo an honeſt man in Rome, of the Catholick Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation, who in reſpect of olde acquaintance with one, or both the prieſts, promiſed to goe with one of them to viſit the 7. Churches (an act of deuotion vſed by all that goe to Rome) but when the day came, he durſt not goe, fot feare leſt the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its ſhould ſhew ouermuch kindneſſe towards him, for this loue towards the prieſt. Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> his loue and confidence ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is not to be meaſured; who, as I haue bene enformed, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to the prieſts, that they had brought with them a letter, which was indorſed or entituled to them in this ſtyle, <hi>To your LL.</hi> by which he, and others at that time, ieſted at their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</hi> And F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in his letter to M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>9.</hi> of <hi>October 1999.</hi> vrgeth the ſame; as alſo this author in the <hi>Apologie, cap. 9 fol. 135.</hi> But when theſe prieſts deſired to ſee that letter, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging oftentimes what comfort it would be vnto them, to ſee their owne <hi>Lordſhips</hi> (ſo often talked of by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> and other Ieſuits) all the loue and confidence, eſpecially which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had, could not worke it: neither would this letter euer be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, as M <hi>Biſhop</hi> teſtifieth in the Engliſh booke, fol. 159. Although ſayth he, it was moſt inſtantly deſired, yea and ſaid to haue been forged, as is ſet down fol. 127. and quietly let ſlip here in the <hi>Apol</hi> which vndertaketh to anſwere that booke.</p>
               <p>Now follow certaine letters of D. <hi>Biſhop</hi> to M. <hi>Colington,</hi> not when hee was at libertie (as here it is ſuggeſted) but a priſoner ſtill, although at more libertie then M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> had: for hee was commanded to the Proctors houſe (as M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> was after his departure) and might not lie in the towne where hee would, and might haue liued without further charge, as alſo M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> might; for that they had agreed for their chamber, and diet for a certaine time, and payd their money beforehand;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:5209:142"/> and were caried away to priſon, before halfe the time was out: and were offered afterward to haue their diet, for ſo many daies as were behind of the reckoning, which were more then either of them had leaue to ſtay in Rome, after their ſeuerall inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the Colledge. And as for this gloſe, that M. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> letter was written eight dayes after the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> was publiſhed, I ſhould haue let it paſſe as one of this authors pety follies, this letter bearing date the 29. of April, as here is ſaid, and the <hi>Breue</hi> bearing date the 6. of April, as in the leafe next before it is twice cited, and elſewhere often in the <hi>Apologie.</hi> But there is a further folly hereupon grounded, or at the leaſt the like more groſſely committed, to ſhew forth F. <hi>Parſons</hi> praiſes concerning a letter next following: at the end of which, thus ſayth this author, <hi>Thus wrote F.</hi> Parſons, <hi>euen then when yet the Popes</hi> Breue <hi>was not come foorth:</hi> was not that kindly done and friendly of F. <hi>Parſons?</hi> But how is it proued, that this letter was written <hi>euen then?</hi> Marke how hee prooueth it: <hi>As appeareth</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>for that this was written the 9. of</hi> April, <hi>and the</hi> Breue <hi>beareth date the 21. of the ſaidmoneth.</hi> The <hi>Breue</hi> which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto borne date of the 6. of <hi>April,</hi> muſt now for to claw Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> be reported, yea and beleeued alſo by the <hi>blind obedient</hi> to beare date the 21. of <hi>April.</hi> Is not this authour very greedy that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhould be commended, who will fetch a matter ſo farre off, and ſo farre from a knowen trueth, to further it; <hi>ergo</hi> not being more common in the ſchooles, then a <hi>Breue</hi> of the 6. of <hi>April</hi> for the Archprieſts confirmation? This letter and other would aske longer ſcanning, then would recompenſe the paines, but to euery mans view they preſent an argument, that the peace was made vpon the Prieſts ſide; and therefore I will briefly goe ouer ſome marginall notes, which are made vpon theſe letters. And firſt I will beginne with the notes made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Maſter <hi>Biſhops</hi> letter, whereupon Father <hi>Parſons</hi> his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, (who was to ouerſee what hee writ into England) how that he had laboured for his libertie: he ſaith, that <hi>hee had his libertie by</hi> F. Parſons <hi>procurement.</hi> There is this note in the margent, <hi>How then doeth hee denie this afterward;</hi> but he telleth him not where: you muſt go looke for that. And in the meane time you muſt thinke, that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> ſaid one thing at one time,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:5209:142"/> and at another time denied the ſame: which hee might very well doe; ſpeaking firſt according to ſuch informations, as <hi>F. Parſons</hi> gaue him, which afterward he might vnderſtand to be falſe. The ſecond note is this, <hi>By this we ſee, how theſe men were pretenders, and could not expect their owne time.</hi> And this note is made vpon <hi>M. Biſhops</hi> good wiſhes to one man, and certificate, that vpon his peaceable behauiour he ſhould be remembred. And what doeth this proue, that the ſame party <hi>pretended</hi> any thing at all? vpon the next letter which is <hi>F. Parſons</hi> to <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> and <hi>M. Muſh,</hi> there is this note, <hi>An obiection anſwered:</hi> and that was, <hi>Fa. Parſons is of an other body, and therefore no friend of theirs.</hi> A ſhrewd obiection, and how is it anſwered? <hi>He hath procured Seminaries for them: and if theſe Seminaries were for men of his owne vocation</hi> (as in deed they are, and to make his faction the ſtronger) <hi>yet they are all to one end, and one publique ſeruice of our countrey.</hi> And if no man wil this beleeue, let him looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his actions of the yeeres 1596, and 97. when diuers prieſts were to come in the Spaniſh Armadoes, vnder pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Engliſh to the Catholicke religion; Let their forced ſubſcriptions to ſtrange titles, proue <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> and his agents their publique ſeruice of our countrey. But after this letter of <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> followeth another of <hi>M. Muſh</hi> to him. And where <hi>M. Muſh</hi> declareth how much <hi>he hath bene bound vnto the</hi> Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and that <hi>it is no ioy for him to be at variance with any: much leſſe with him, or any of his ſocietie;</hi> there is this note in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>Exore tuo te iudico, &amp;c.</hi> If there be any relation to that, which followeth <hi>by &amp;c.</hi> It is but an ordinary liuery, which this author giueth at his pleaſure, <hi>I iudge thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by thine owne mouth.</hi> as though <hi>M. Muſh</hi> did now profeſſe, that <hi>hee tooke ioy to be at variance with any,</hi> or that he denied, that he hath bene heretofore <hi>bound vnto the Societie,</hi> hauing bene many yeeres ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a member thereof, although in the ende they would not admit him, as here it is confeſſed <hi>fol. 107.</hi> In this ſame letter <hi>M. Muſh</hi> requeſting, that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> might be ſent home from their baniſhment, biddeth him not to feare any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance by them: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their owne hands will testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, if they ſhall report, or attempt any euill.</hi> Whereupon there is this note made, <hi>This testimonie we accept now against
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:5209:143"/> them;</hi> But he ſheweth not where they haue reported, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any euill. Let this be ſhewed, and then let their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be vrged againſt them. To this letter doeth <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> reply, and ſpeaking of the returne of theſe two prieſts, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this caſe, <hi>If their cooperation be vnderſtood, to worke with you by their letters, as here they promiſed, and I cannot doubt, but they will performe.</hi> Vpon this place there is this note made, <hi>Here we ſee the good man was deceiued.</hi> And why ſo good man? did they not <hi>cooperate</hi> with the prieſts in England for the making of peace? Are not their letters continually vrged againſt the prieſts in England, as exhorting them to peace? did they not teſtifie the copy of the <hi>Breue</hi> to be a true copy thereof, by which peace was made? Is not <hi>M. Biſhops</hi> letter here inſerted, a ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his <hi>cooperation;</hi> and what teſtimony is that, which is accepted here (in a marginal note vpon <hi>F. Parſons</hi> letter;) but of peace wrought or perſwaded by them? And how then <hi>was the goodman deceiued?</hi> Perchance it was in that, which for all the reſt alſo deceiued him; that was, hauing now gotten a <hi>Breue</hi> for confirmation of the Archprieſt, he expected that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might trample vpon the prieſts as them liſted, and that now all the prieſts would be foole-ridden, or worſe, and muſt not ſtirre for any iniury, whatſoeuer might be offered them; wherein in deed we may ſee, <hi>how the goodman was deceiued.</hi> Vpon the ſame letter there is a note made, that <hi>the reconciliation of</hi> M. D. Bagſhaw <hi>was an outward ſhew.</hi> And after the letter this inſinuation is giuen, that <hi>any indifferent man may perceiue how</hi> F. Parſons <hi>was deſirous and carefull of peace.</hi> But of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when I ſhall diſcouer how he behaued himſelfe for the putting all out of hope of peace.</p>
               <p>Diuers other letters follow of <hi>F. Garnet,</hi> and the Archprieſt to <hi>F. Parſons:</hi> all concluding, that there was a peace made, and that there was no doubt of any, but of <hi>D. Bagſhaw,</hi> who (what cauſe ſoeuer he had to ſtand vpon the reſtitution of his good name) being accompred (as other were) for a <hi>Schiſmaticke, &amp;c.</hi> yeelded himſelfe. And this author confeſſeth here <hi>fol. 148.</hi> that it is moſt likely, that diuers of them ment plainly, and ſincerely indeed: though of ſome of them it is doubted, that they made the peace only in external ſhew for the time, <hi>aſſuring themſelues</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:5209:143"/> (ſaith he) <hi>that there would not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſome probable occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, afterwards to break againe, &amp; to lay the cauſe of breach vpon the other ſide, as in effect we ſee it did inſue.</hi> But was the heate of faction and ſedition ſo great in the Ieſuites and the Archprieſt, as the prieſts could perceiue it, &amp; thereupon aſſure themſelues, that there <hi>would not want ſome probable occaſion to breake againe?</hi> Or had <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> ſo laide the plot himſelfe, that there ſhould be no peace in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but with ſuch conditions as no honeſt prieſt could accept? Yet this wee haue, that a peace was made by ſome for peace ſake, and by the reſt alſo, at the leaſt vpon this aſſurance, that <hi>afterward there would not want ſome probable occaſion, to breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> But ſee how this fellow goeth on with his tale: <hi>For that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a new deuiſe being caſt out ſhortly after, that ſatisfaction muſt be made to them for ſome former hard ſpeeches vſed, or written againſt them in time of the contention, and that otherwiſe their good names ſhould be taken from them. This was a ſufficient match to put fire againe to all that, which had bene raked vp before, by the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the foreſaid peace.</hi> But this narration wil not paſſe ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. The prieſts haue ſet downe in the booke dedicated to his Holineſſe, pag. 63. and in that to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> pag. 59.60. that after the peace was made, a Ieſuit <hi>Fa. Iones</hi> by name, began to raiſe that wicked and ſenſeleſſe ſlander of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> againſt them. And M. Archprieſt publiſhed <hi>A Reſolution,</hi> pretended to come from Rome in confirmation of that wicked opinion of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits againſt the prieſts, and that the ſatisfaction which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded was of this infamy rayſed, after the peace was made, and not of thoſe wicked ſlanders, which were rayſed by the Ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, the Archprieſt, and their ſeditious adherents againſt the prieſts, before the peace was made, as here is falſely ſuggeſted. And this relation of the prieſts goeth ſtill vncontrolled, and not diſprooued by this authour. And by this might this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be ſolued, which followeth in the <hi>Apologie. Now then, all the queſtion ſtandeth in this, which part hath broken the peace, or which was moſt like to haue deſire, to maintaine and conſerue the ſame.</hi> For by this it is euident, that the Ieſuites and Archprieſt did breake the ſame peace, and <hi>put fire againe to all that which had bene raked vp before.</hi> But marke I pray you, how ſubſtantially this queſtion propoſed is diſcuſſed by him: <hi>For diſcuſsing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:5209:144"/> controuerſie, we might vſe that argument of</hi> Caſſius, Cui bono? <hi>who are like to receiue moſt good or hurt by the peace kept or broken?</hi> Here you ſee what argument this authour might vſe: you ſhall perchance hereafter vnderſtand what argument hee will vſe. For this in his owne conſcience was no ſufficient argument, or doubtleſſe he would haue vſed it, hauing ſo great want of good arguments, as here he diſcouereth, yet the margent muſt cary this note. <hi>The controuerſie diſcuſſed, who did breake the peace:</hi> to giue the reader to vnderſtand, that here the controuerſie is diſcuſſed, who perchance would thinke as litle thereof, as he who paſſeth through <hi>Long lane,</hi> by <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and looketh at the ſigne of <hi>the Booke,</hi> would thinke of <hi>the Bible</hi> if this note were not vpon the ſigne: <hi>The Bible.</hi> But as this authour might make this argument, ſo might the prieſts fit this anſwere; that ſuch circumſtances might bee iuſtly conſidered in controuerſies, where no euidence is to be had which part had deſerued blame, although in ſuch alſo there might be iolly wrangling, euery circumſtance almoſt being of force to make the harme or the good greater, which ſhold enſue vpon a peace broken or kept. But in this caſe there is no ſuch want of euidence, as the matter muſt of neceſſitie be determined by any vncertaine circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. For the prieſts all ege and pleade, that after the peace was made, <hi>Fa. Iones</hi> the Ieſuit rayſed out of hell that ſeditious, and moſt wicked ſlander <hi>of ſchiſme</hi> againſt them, in which hee affirmed afreſh, that they had liued, while they differred to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Archprieſt, not yet confirmed by his Holineſſe in that authority which the Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> had giuen him, and he had vſurped as an intruder, before he had the Popes letters for his lawfull exerciſe thereof. The prieſtes affirme alſo that the Archprieſt after the peace made, did publiſh <hi>A Reſolution</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from Rome, wherein the prieſts were condemned <hi>for Schiſmatickes,</hi> who were refufers of the authority appointed, as is aforſaid. And this to haue beene done by the Archprieſt, was ſo publikely knowen, that euery man, but the wilful deafe, did heare of it: &amp; his letters flew about with this <hi>Reſolution.</hi> And wil this author that this matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced by facts, ſhold be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits &amp; circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances? If a man of poſſeſſions known to be very rich, ſhould ſpoile a man by the high way, &amp; ſhould
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:5209:144"/> be taken with the maner, &amp; brought before a Iudge, why might he not affirme that the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſaulted him, &amp; plead before the Iudge, <hi>Cui bone?</hi> He was a rich man &amp; of great poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the other was a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what reaſon had he with ſuch danger to ſeeke the ſpoile of the poore man? wil the Iudge leaue the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and anſwere to <hi>Cuibono?</hi> But yet, notwithſtanding that it is ſo euident, that the Ieſuits and Archprieſts brake the peace (as this author taking vpon him to anſwere theſe bookes) let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inſtances giuen paſſe by very quietly, not being able to confute them, leſt hee ſhould bring all but his like impudent companions, about his eares; the Archprieſt his letters being common enough to diſprooue his falſhood: the petition alſo being extant which the prieſts made hereupon vnto him, that the queſtion might be diſputed among themſelues, and (this being denyed) their ſending to the moſt learned Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> to haue it there decided: vpon the moſt immodeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whereof by the Archprieſt, the prieſts were forced to flie to his Holines, and the Sea Apoſtolicke for ſuccour:) yet (I ſay) let vs ſee, how this author doth handle his <hi>Cuibono: For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Archprieſt and the Clergie ioyned with him, enioyed by the peace all that they could deſire: to wit, quiet eſtabliſhment of their ſubordination, honour, reputation, reſt, quietneſſe, and his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe confirmation of all their doings. The Ieſuits alſo had as much as they could deſire, and were ſatisfied in all points, as appeareth by their owne letters aboue recited. But on the other ſide enſued the quite contrary in all reſpects, ſo as it could not be imagined, but that by this pacification they receiued</hi> ſecundum hominem, <hi>much griefe and inward indignation.</hi> See you not the pregnancie of this authors wit, &amp; what a ſtrong argument he might vſe? A tyrant hauing obtained by ſuch meanes as he vſed, to be admitted as a lawfull king, beginneth againe to ſhewe his diſpoſition amongſt his ſubiects; eſpecially againſt ſuch as would not at the firſt yeeld themſelues, or acknowledge his vſurped authoritie: and when he hath deſtroyed them, or as many of them as he may, or hath a wicked mind to deſtroy, what hindereth him, that he cannot lay the blame of this breach of peace vpon thoſe whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and plead for himſelfe, <hi>Cuibono?</hi> For he <hi>enioyed by the peace, all that he could deſire, to wit, quiet eſtabliſhment</hi> of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:5209:145"/> 
                  <hi>honour, reputation, reſt, quietneſſe, his confirmation alſo</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by ſome higher power. His intruders alſo, or ſetters on in that courſe, had as much as they could deſire, and were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all points: but on the other ſide enſued quite contrary in all reſpects. So as it could not bee imagined, but that by this pacification, and the tyrants atchieuing the ſoueraignty, <hi>they receiued</hi> ſecundum hominem, <hi>much griefe and inward indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Is not <hi>Cuibono</hi> a ſtout argument? But this compariſon is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, betweene a tyrant, and a graue Catholike Archprieſt. There is no compariſon made betweene them, but it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how fooliſh an argument this author might haue vſed, if he would haue vrged <hi>Cuibono.</hi> But yet in this narration of honor, and reputation giuen to the Archprieſt, there are two things to be noted; the one is, that it is moſt falſe which is here infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>the Archpriest, and the Cleargie ioyned with him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed his Holineſſe confirmation of all their doings.</hi> His Holineſſe confirmed the Cardinal <hi>Caietans</hi> letters, by which M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> was made an Archprieſt, and a Superiour: but to make this ſtretch to the confirmation of all that, which hee, and others ioyned with him did in that time, is both abſurd, and a moſt impious ſlander of the Pope, their doings hauing beene moſt wicked and ſcandalous, yea and moſt iniurious to many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike prieſts, as it was openly enough ſeen by diuers others, but principally by that infamous imputation of <hi>ſchiſme, ſedition, &amp;c.</hi> The other thing, which is here to bee noted, is, that this being ſuppoſed, that all theſe had what they could deſire, and contrariwiſe the other had all the contrary, the Ieſuits and the Archprieſt could not without an exceeding bad intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, raiſe again that ſlander of <hi>Schiſme</hi> againſt the prieſts, after the peace was made; knowing, or being bound to know, that the prieſts could not in conſcience put it vp, howſoeuer before they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for peace ſake to forgiue them their firſt outrage.</p>
               <p>But now followeth the argument belike which this authour will vrge: for all this is onely what he might doe. And this new argument conſiſteth vpon two principall points: The firſt is, that ſuppoſing all the foreſaid honours on the one ſide, and the diſgraces on the other ſide, were diſgeſted by vertue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, humilitie, obedience, and mortification of minde, his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:5209:145"/> reader muſt conſider, <hi>how matters ſtood with them, or ſome of them at the leaſt, and with the Archprieſt at the comming of the</hi> Breue. The ſecond is, <hi>how theſe matters ſtood with them and the Councell, and ſome great men of the aduerſary part.</hi> The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is ſo ſlenderly handled, and in a manner annexed with the ſecond, as if the laſt were the onely thing, vpon which this authour would rely, for the declaration of this queſtion, which he thus propoſed: <hi>which part hath broken the peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The matters as they ſtood betwixt the prieſts and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, he explicateth by an appeale, which ſome prieſts had made a little before the <hi>Breue</hi> came, which was an argument that <hi>the wound was greene:</hi> and his reader muſt vnderſtand, that by this appeale there was <hi>an egregious faction meant:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Appeale was made in the names of the preſent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants, and <hi>all others that ſhould ioyne themſelues vnto them.</hi> (which clauſe was after the Appeale, and onely in a poſtſcript, as it is ſet downe in the booke to the Inquiſition, pag. 52.) And to colour this matter the better, the date of the Appeale is tranſported to the poſtſcript which he citeth, <hi>which is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt the nature of iuſt Appeales:</hi> for which you muſt take his credit. But let vs grant, that theſe Appellants had miſtaken <hi>Panormitane,</hi> explicating the rubricke of the chapter, <hi>Olim de occaſionibus,</hi> &amp; had put in this clauſe into their Appeale, (which as is ſaid is in a poſtſcript after the Appeale) how is it prooued that there is <hi>an egregious faction meant</hi> thereby? How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might it be ſayd, that there was a marueilous contempt of the Sea Apoſtolike committed by the Archpr. in ſuſpending the Appellants from the vſe of their faculties, after this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale made to the Sea Apoſtolike? Againe, if we ſhall conſider the backwardneſſe of the Appellants, to doe or attempt any thing which might be offenſiue to any (which they ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, in that they hereupon refrained to vſe their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) and the forwardnes of the Archpr. who would vſurpe ſuch an authoritie; before he was confirmed by his Holineſſe (ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared by this irreuerence, to the Sea Apoſtolike, in taking away from the Appellants, the vſe of their faculties for Appealing) it will be euident to the indifferent iudge, which part was more likely to haue a bad meaning, for <hi>factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:5209:146"/> of the Church. <hi>But this was deuiſed perhaps</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand by the perſecutors themſelues &amp;c.</hi> and ſo hee falleth into that point, of the ſtanding of matters betweene the prieſts, and the Counſel, which I will leaue a little, and trie, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this coniecture already giuen, of the Archprieſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his factious adherents, I can alleage any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby it may be coniectured, that the Ieſuits, and Archp. did meane <hi>an egregious faction,</hi> whatſoeuer ſhew they would make of peace, firſt occurreth a letter which was written from Rome, by M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> one of the two Proctors appointed by the Archpr. and the Clergie vnited vnto him, and allowed by his Holineſſe, as in this letter he affirmeth. Which letter, being a pretended relation of ſuch principall matters, as you ſhall heare, was eyther penned by <hi>Fa Parſons,</hi> or not without his priuitie: being (as all Rome can teſtifie) the principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent againſt the prieſts, and one who thought nothing could be well done to his minde, vnleſſe he were himſelfe at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therof, as appeared by his apprehending them, his keeping them, his examining them, and ſuch like his charitable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This letter beareth date the 20. of <hi>February</hi> 1599. And herein is his deere friend certified, that the matter, about which the two prieſts went to Rome, was committed by his holineſſe ſpeciall commiſſion, to Card. <hi>Caietane,</hi> and <hi>Burgheſe,</hi> to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and heard by way of congregation at the Engliſh Coll. it ſelfe. <hi>And ſo it was</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>vpon Wedneſday, the ſeuenteenth of this moneth: when after ſundry informations had from</hi> Acariſius <hi>Fiſcal, of his Hol Congregation of reformation, that had taken their ſeuerall examinations</hi> (by his attourney <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi>) <hi>vpon their oathes. And after they</hi> (the Cardinals) <hi>had read and viewed ſuch letters, memorials and papers, as the Ambaſſadours had brought with them, they came ioyntly together to the Colledge vpon the foreſayd day, and with them the ſayd Fiſcall. And there hauing a conuenient tribunall prouided in fourme of iudgement</hi> (a couple of chaires ſet at a table couered with a greene cloth) <hi>they heard the whole cauſe,</hi> (but God knoweth who pleaded it.) <hi>And firſt each of the Ambaſſadours confeſsion and declaration</hi> (that is, as much, and what pleaſed <hi>Fa Parſons</hi>) <hi>ſeuerally read by the Notary of the cauſe,</hi> (<hi>Fa Henry Tichborne</hi> a Ieſuite) <hi>which were long, and euer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:5209:146"/> auoide tediouſnes, there was a little read here and there, where <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> had turned downe a leaſe, and his fellow Ieſuit (the foreſaid Notary of the cauſe) was made acquainted therewith, and read accordingly. <hi>And then was each of them willed to ſay, if he had any thing to adde to his declaration more then hee had ſet downe,</hi> M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> would ſay nothing, for which as was ſayd, the Cardinals were offended with him: M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> deliuered ſomewhat, vntill <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> did breake him off. <hi>And after this their letters and papers brought with them were ſeene againe by the aforeſayd iudges, whereof the moſt part were tranſlated into Latine.</hi> (Is it likely that the prieſts would write to his Holineſſe in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh? for the petitions were to him, which were brought by the two prieſts to Rome, and concerned their buſineſſe) <hi>And beſides that, were alſo</hi> Fa.

And theſe procurators being willed to ſpeake like Proctors, ſayd not one word, but <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> at their entrance began to declare vnto the Cardinals, that thoſe two were Proctors for the Archpr. and that one of them was a Doctor of Diuinitie, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of a Cardinal, and the brother of a Martyr, (<hi>agnominations</hi> able to credit the beſt Proctors in the world) After this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, hee told the Cardinall, what a perillous diuiſion was made in England: and that theſe proctors, although they were very loth to deale againſt their brethren there preſent, yet for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:5209:147"/> the loue of Iuſtice, they were contented to be imployed in this action againſt them, and that they had a libell or bill of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt them. At which words D. <hi>Haddocke</hi> (without any word ſpeaking himſelfe) deliuered vp a libell to the Card. But let vs heare what M. <hi>Array</hi> certifieth his friend of his ſpeeches or his fellow Proctors, when (as he ſayth) they were bidden to ſpeake as Proctors. <hi>Our ſpeech in effect was</hi> (ſayth he, when they ſayd not one word) <hi>that albeit it grieueth vs much to be driuen to accuſe or pleade against our brethren Prieſts, that had beene of the ſame Colledge and Vniuerſitie here in Rome, and had gone hence into England iointly to labour, and aduenture our liues for the ſame cauſe of the Catholike faith, though before them,</hi> (and were quickly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof) <hi>yet their maner of proceeding had been, and was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to common peace</hi> (theſe good Proctors were 12 yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or there about gone out of England) <hi>and vnion, and ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to all good and honeſt men, that either we muſt oppoſe our ſelues againſt them in the name of our head</hi> (they meane the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt who was not their head, they liuing at Rome) <hi>and of all the reſt of our Catholike body in England and abroad</hi> (they wil make their foreſayd head a yong Pope) <hi>or els we ſhould ſeeme to betray the ſame cauſe impugned by them.</hi> O ſcrupulous conſcience! who would thinke that all his tale were onely an imagination, what might haue been ſayd, neither he, nor his fellow Proctor hauing as yet vttered one word? But let vs heare this ſaint make an end of this lewde and lowde lie. <hi>Wherefore wee prayed their Graces</hi> (in what language?) <hi>not to be ſcandalized to ſee this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst vs, for that theſe were the moaths</hi> (O gentle mouthes ſpeake) <hi>that did breed in the beſt clothes, and the wormes</hi> (O noble Proctor) <hi>that were commonly found vnder the barke of euery tree, if they were not looked to in time, and that this happened alſo in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie primitiue Church, permitted by God for the better proofe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of good men. And that this was a very hereſie in maners, &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as th'other in Protestants was in faith and Religion: &amp; that this would breake into that in time, if that it were not looked into, as in diuers</hi> (of the Ieſuits darlings) <hi>it had done already, and muſt needs doe: For that it was contention founded vpon the ſame grounds of emulation, euery ambition, hatred, couetouſnes and libertie of life, as the other hereſie was, and wrought a ſpirit conforme to that in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects

But marke I pray you yet a moſt wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and which may conuince more euidently (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) that theſe fellowes would not haue peace. <hi>And then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we gaue vp a writing which before had bene exhibited vnto his Holines, &amp; was remitted hither as it ſeemeth,</hi> (it ſeemed ſo indeed, for <hi>D Haddocke</hi> had it ready to giue vp to the Cardinals ſo ſoone as <hi>F.

But let this paſſe, let vs heare what he ſaith was anſwered by the prieſts to all theſe grieuous accuſations; <hi>Againſt all which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Ambaſſadors were able to ſay little, and willing to ſay leſſe, but onely excuſed their owne intentions, and asked pardon, if they had giuen ſcandall by their maner of proceeding, more then they euer meant.</hi> But put the caſe indeed, as it was, and as the Card. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſius</hi> without doubt will acknowledge, and the Ieſuits with all the reſt of that faction then preſent, muſt auouch it one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne ſoules, will they, nill they, that <hi>Fa.

To which when the Card. <hi>Caietan</hi> would not conſent, he requeſted that a copy of the Libel might be deliuered vnto him, &amp; his fellow, that they might make their anſwere vnto it, as moſt falſe, and iniurious: whereat <hi>D.

To which the Card. <hi>Caietan</hi> preſently conſented, the ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance for ioy, that both the Proctors were not dumbe: for before this acte of <hi>D.

And if this were neceſſary to be done, <hi>lest that they ſhould ſeeme to betray the cauſe impugned by the two priests,</hi> (as this fellow ſaith in this letter) muſt not conſequently this cauſe be a moſt fowle cauſe, which muſt be vpholden with ſuch ſhameleſſe falſhood? could theſe fellowes thinke that Maſter <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:5209:148"/> ſhould euer come to the ſight of this relation of theirs, and helde themſelues from declaring it to be (as in deede it is) a moſt falſe, wicked, and malicious information? or can theſe men thinke, that theſe means were meanes for peace, and not rather occaſions to breake peace, when they ſhould come to light? But this was not the firſt plot which was layd, by which their intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is diſcouered neuer to haue had peace. There is another letter written by <hi>Fa.

Thus he writ. <hi>I haue receiued, &amp;c.

Gifford, Bagſhaw, Collington, <hi>or</hi> Biſhop. <hi>They ſay, if they had not their requeſt, experience would teach,</hi> quod indignabitur libertas, ſi prematur, (that is to ſay, that liberty would be offended, if it were preſſed) <hi>Theſe were their words. Now the caſe is altered, and they ſeeme changed, and ſory that they tooke ſuch a iourney in hand: ſeeing that nothing elſe, but ambition hath egged them thus farre foorth, &amp;c.</hi> Could the ſpreading of theſe moſt notorious falſhoods, be ſignes of any other thing, then of a deſire that there ſhould bee no peace? How could theſe fellowes thinke or perſwade themſelues, that when theſe tales came to the eares of the two prieſts thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they would not be contradicted? was this it, which is ment by the <hi>Apologie, fol. 148.</hi> where it is ſayd, that <hi>the Prieſts aſſured themſelues, that there would not want ſome probable occaſion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to breake againe?</hi> Was the authour of the <hi>Apologie</hi> priuie to theſe occaſions? But how could theſe be occaſions of the breach: ſeeing that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> knewe not of this falſe dealing, as being in baniſhment, beſides that the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:5209:149"/> breach was made againe, before that theſe wicked dealings came to their knowledge. You are therefore to vnderſtand, that theſe are brought to ſhewe that theſe fellowes could not haue any deſire of peace, who could diſperſe ſuch falſe &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tales againſt thoſe Prieſts, and in them againſt all the reſt, by whom theſe were imployed to his Holineſſe. And becauſe perchance they perceiued, that theſe &amp; other their plots would not fadge to their mind, and that notwithſtanding the <hi>ſolemne inquirie of their life, and maners</hi> commanded by Cardinall <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, 10. Nouemb. 1598. the treatiſe of ſchiſme,</hi> and other iniuries offered vnto them, and to the prieſts imployed by them) they did all (contrary to their aduerſaries expectations) ſubmit them ſelues preſently vpon the ſight of his Holines <hi>Breue,</hi> the Ieſuits were conſtrained to goe to worke ſo openly, as all the world cryeth out ſhame vpon them. For when peace was made, they fell to a freſh declaring, that the refuſers of the appointed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had bene <hi>Schiſmatikes:</hi> which in all reaſon they thought was more then <hi>a probable occaſion</hi> to breake the peace againe, and that their barbarous handling of thoſe prieſts which were firſt ſent to Rome, to haue dealt with his Holineſſe, would be ſuch a terrour to them, as they would neuer ſend the ſecond time, ſo as they might tyrannize at pleaſure, ouer whom they liſted, and principally intended (perchance at the firſt) as not being now very likely to put vp the ſecond time ſo ſcandalous, and vnworthy reproches: nor (as they hoped) would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to attempt againe to get ſome remedy.</p>
               <p>This firſt point being ſufficiently declared, how matters ſtood betweene the Archprieſt, and his adherents on the one part, and with the prieſts on the other part: nowe followeth this Authours information, how they ſtood with the counſell, and great men of the one part, and the Prieſtes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part. For out of theſe two conſiderations hee will haue his reader to gather, <hi>which part broke the peace,</hi> or was more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keepe it. The firſt conſideration he diſpatched briefly, and declared that <hi>the wound was greene,</hi> when the <hi>Breue</hi> came: which he proueth by an Appeale made by ſome of the prieſts: for which the Appellants were by the Archprieſt depriued of the vſe of their faculties. The ſeconde hee beginneth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:5209:149"/> in ſhewing, howe by certaine wordes in the Appeale it may bee gathered, that there was <hi>an egregious faction, as deuiſed perhaps vnder-hand by the perſecutors themſelues.</hi> See how he falleth into the conſideration with <hi>a perhaps,</hi> and then goeth thus forwards: <hi>who hauing with them at London at this time (if he were not very lately returned) D.</hi> Bagſhaw, <hi>called vp as is ſuppoſed, by his owne procurement, it is very likely they agreed with him, that in no caſe whatſoeuer determination ſhould come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, peace ſhould be made, or kept with the Archprieſt, and Ieſuits.</hi> How many things muſt a man ſuppoſe, before he come to imagine, that one man meant not to haue peace with the Archprieſt and Ieſuits? which, if it ſhould be graunted to this fellow, how would he hereupon inferre, that there was <hi>an egregious faction</hi> meant by thoſe Appellants, of which this man of whome hee ſpeaketh, was none, but rather of a contrary diſpoſition, as this author confeſſeth in this place: where he addeth, <hi>which point it may be Ma.</hi> Collington <hi>and Ma.</hi> Muſh, <hi>two of the three Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, did ſomewhat gueſſe at, when they ſhewed ſo much doubt to the Archprieſt, as before you haue heard, of bringing D.</hi> Bagſhaw <hi>into this reconciliation?</hi> And to further this conceit, that M. Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> had dealings with the Councell, there is a letter of a <hi>reuerend</hi> prieſt dated the 15. of <hi>April</hi> 1599. which is full of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh iealouſies, and ſenſleſſe ſurmiſes, it being well knowen, that M. Doct. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> was ſent for from <hi>Wisbich</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to anſwer for his life, being moſt falſely and vnchriſtianlike accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to haue had part in that Spaniſh treachery, for which <hi>Squire</hi> was put to death: although this author in the 13. chap. fol. 207. doth moſt ſhameleſſely auouch, that <hi>as ſoone as euer they</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>vnderſtood that their two meſſengers were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Rome</hi> (which was not before the 29. of <hi>December</hi>) <hi>and not like to preuaile</hi> (which could not be ſo ſoone knowen in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) <hi>then</hi> D. Bagſhaw <hi>was ſent for from</hi> Wisbich <hi>to</hi> London <hi>to treat with the Councell:</hi> and all England can witneſſe, that he was ſent for by the Councell about the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> before the two prieſts were impriſoned. But next after theſe authenticall ſurmiſes of one of the fellowe vnited brethren (but a <hi>reuerend</hi> one, and therefore muſt carry credit, howſoeuer this <hi>Apologie</hi> hath cracked it) there followed another letter of another <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:5209:150"/> prieſt, who affirmeth that D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> is at the laſt conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld his obedience to their Superiour, with the reſt of his confederats: <hi>If it be true</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that M.</hi> Muſh <hi>and ſome others affirme.</hi> And yet there is a greater argument, but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M. <hi>Bluet. If</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>the ſaid keeper of</hi> Wisbich <hi>caſtle doe not greatly abuſe M.</hi> Bluet. And this ſtanding vpon ſo nice a point, I will leaue to them, who haue will to compare their honeſties together, and conclude contrarily to this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors concluſion, fol. 153. for there he concludeth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>By this then and diuers other wayes, which we leaue to ſpeake of heere,</hi> (the prieſts are much bound to him for ſparing them) <hi>it is eaſie to ſee what manner of negotiation theſe men had in hand, when the</hi> Breue <hi>came, and how farre they were embarked, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, &amp;c.</hi> (you muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue ſome ſtrange linke by this <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>with the Councell at this very time.</hi> How gladly would any blind man ſee this, and bragge when he hath done with the beſt ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? For who, that hath his eyes, can ſee any ſuch matter out of theſe fond ſurmiſes, out of their owne letters, and a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of a man of whome they themſelues haue ſome doubt, whether hee did not abuſe the party, whome he tooke for his author? who doth not rather ſee, to what poore ſhifts this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is driuen, who to determine ſo weightie a queſtion, as he propoſed fol. 148. <hi>which part hath broken the peace,</hi> can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but <hi>perhaps,</hi> and <hi>as is ſuppoſed,</hi> and <hi>it is very likely,</hi> and <hi>it may be,</hi> and <hi>it is thought:</hi> with other ſuch fooliſh ſuſpicions and doubts, of which all this diſcourſe is full, from the firſt entrance into the <hi>conſideration of much more conſequence,</hi> fol. 144. to this concluſion, <hi>By this then, fol. 153.</hi> How much more directly doe the prieſts in all places ſolue this queſtion, affirming without any ſuch fooliſh ſhuffling, that the Ieſuits firſt (namely F. <hi>Iones</hi>) began this breach, by broaching afreſh, that the prieſts were <hi>ſchiſmatickes?</hi> And the Archprieſt ſeconded him with a moſt ſeditious letter which hee ſent abroad: wherein hee ſignified, that he had receiued <hi>a reſolution from the mother Citie, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers of the appointed authoritie were ſchiſmatikes.</hi> And this haue the prieſts ſet downe in their bookes, to haue beene the cauſe of the breach: and this cannot be denyed to haue beene done by the Archprieſt after the peace was made: although this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:5209:150"/> in chap. 11. fol. 167. taketh notice, that in the booke to his Holineſſe, pa. 62. there is this marginall note, <hi>Origo nouarum contentionum fuit Archipresbyteri Epiſtola violenta. The beginning of new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions, was a violent Epiſtle of the Archprieſt.</hi> And vpon this note, he exclaimeth in his religious maner againſt the prieſts, that they would breake out againe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an angry epiſtle. And he runneth himſelfe ſo out of breath, as although this note is ſet at the very bottome of the 62. page, he could not ſtep ouer to the 63 page, where ſome part of this angry epiſtle is thus ſet downe. <hi>Ab vrbe &amp;c. we haue receiued a reſolution from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citie, that the refuſers of the appointed authority, were ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> But the marginall note was ynough for him to exerciſe his milde ſpirit againſt the prieſts: and by concealing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that note was made, and what was in the diſcourſe, to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his blinde reader, who muſt not once looke into the prieſts bookes, for feare leſt their guides falſeneſſe be diſcouered.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed, how the Ieſuits &amp; the Archprieſts want of conſideration hath bene the cauſe of all theſe preſent broiles, and that this diuiſion ſhould not onely not be cured, but be brought in time to a greater breach, as by the euent we haue ſeene performed. Whereby alſo it appeareth how falſe this narration is of this author. <hi>For firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vnder the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made vnto them of their fames wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I was inforced</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vpon their contentions, and contemptuous behauiour</hi> (that is their appeale from him to the Pope, as is ſet downe in the booke to the <hi>Inquiſition epist. 52. &amp; 53.</hi>) <hi>to ſuſpend the vſe of faculties in</hi> M.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:5209:151"/> that there was <hi>delay made</hi> of reconciliation vnder pretence of hauing ſatisfaction; which howſoeuer the accuſers of the prieſts ſhall make to God, they are neuer able to make to them. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>new quarels pickt, new complaints fained, new exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations made, by words and writings both againſt the Archprieſt</hi> (the cauſes hereof are layd downe before, and the whole ſtory at large ſent to the Inquiſition) <hi>the Cardinals protections, and</hi> F.

Martin Array,</hi> and <hi>Fa. Baldwines</hi> bolt to <hi>D. Cicyll</hi> before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted came to be examined, and were euident arguments of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (to ſay no worſe) and lewd dealing, and the breach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed before by the Ieſuits, and Archprieſt (as is ſhewed) might giue the prieſts iuſt cauſe to looke further into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then they could before ſuſpect: but when were theſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels pickt? by whom? or how followed? marke I pray you how he falleth into a ſtory impertinent to theſe controuerſies. The peace was made by the prieſts in <hi>May 1599</hi> as in this chapter is confeſſed, the breach was preſently after made by the Ieſuits, and the Archprieſt, as this author doeth in a maner confeſſe, in that neither of himſelfe, nor prouoked thereto by the prieſts their books he will come neere to this point, which is the moſt principall in this preſent controuerſie; and now he will tel you a tale of <hi>M Charnocke</hi> his returne, which was a yeere after, to wit in <hi>May 1600. who</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>was inuited to come home, and ſo hee did,</hi> no doubt much againſt this fellowes will, who (if I am not deceiued) was the cauſe of his <hi>baniſhment and confinement</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any maintenance, to keepe him in caſe for euer comming home, and to aggrauat the matter <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> is ſaid to haue made a <hi>ridiculous appeale</hi> from the ſentence of the two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. But I thinke that this fellows worſhip did not laugh when he heard of it Yea and more then this <hi>he came to Paris,</hi> and tooke degree of Bachelor of diuinitie, which perchance troubled this fellowes worſhip, as much as the appeale, and thereupon he doeth ſo iuggle it with <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> his taking degree of doctor, <hi>forbidden</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>by an expreſſe Breue,</hi> that his Reader may
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:5209:151"/> thincke <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> had committed ſome great offence, and yet this author meane nothing leſſe, but that he layde all the offence vpon doctor <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who was before, and not at that time made Doctor as he would ſeeme to ſay, and was lawfully made, and worthily, and no way contrary to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Breue,</hi> which was gotten of the Pope not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctoring without approbation, as here is moſt falſly noted in the margent, but againſt the doctoring of yong men, and ſuch (by explication of thoſe, who procured the <hi>Breue</hi>) as would take the degree more timely, then the ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their aduerſaries could well like of. But to returne to his tale of M. <hi>Charnocke. Here then</hi> (that is at <hi>Paris</hi>) <hi>it was reſolued</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>notwithſtanding his Holines prohibition,</hi> (that is to ſay, the ſentence of the two Cardinals, <hi>Caietane,</hi> and <hi>Burgheſe,</hi> from which he had lawfully appealed, which alſo M. doctor <hi>Ely</hi> confirmeth in his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie</hi> pag 157. and thereby ſet himſelfe free vntill the matter were againe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed) <hi>and his owne oath to the contrary</hi> (which he neuer tooke nor was any offered him, when the ſentence here ſpecified fol. 155 was ſhewed him by <hi>Fa.

To the which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne this anſwer, with as great reſpect as the law was in which they were written: I doe not well vnderſtand how the notice of my going into England, ſhould be vngratefull, either to his Holineſſe, or vnto your Highneſſe, when as neither a moſt louing Father, nor a moſt iuſt Iudge, can be ignorant, that foode is as needfull for the liuing, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the offendor. The Rector, or Vicerector of the Engliſh College in Rome was appointed by letters of the moſt illuſtrious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> Caietan <hi>of good memory, and of your Highneſſe, dated from both your pallaces 21. of</hi> Aprill <hi>1599. to ſignifie vnto vs in your names, that we ſhould not preſume for a time to goe without leaue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdomes of England, Scotland, or Ireland, but ſhould liue quietly, peaceably, and religiouſly in other Catholike countreys, where we ſhould be appointed by you, and that we ſhould procure the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of peace euery where among the Engliſh Catholickes. If either of them had ſignified vnto vs in your names, or in the names of any other, where baniſhed and confined men ſhould haue had thoſe things which were neceſsary to ſuſtaine life, and that theſe things had bene at hand, I might haue bene charged with diſobedience, and breach of an expreſſe commandement, not obeying ſo pious an intention of the decree, which layd vpon me a moſt grieuous (howſoeuer vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) puniſhment, as being hereby made ſomewhat tollerable, and the oath had not bene a bonde of ſo great wickedneſſe, if I had taken any, not to returne into my Countrey.</hi> M.

As how? <hi>For within fourteene dayes after this his letter to the Cardinall, there followed their greateſt appeale from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt.</hi> A great matter againſt M. <hi>Charnocke.</hi> Might he not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well haue ſayd, that it was about a moneth after that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Burgheſius</hi> letter came into England to M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> and haue layd the blame (if appealing deſerued blame) vpon the Cardinall? If any man will take the paines to looke vpon the cauſes of the Appeale ſet downe in Engliſh in Ma. <hi>Colingtons</hi> booke pag. 192. to the 202 page, he ſhall finde aſmuch reaſon for the one as for the other, and that the grieuances were moſt intollerable which were offered them, long before M. <hi>Charn.</hi> returne into England, and were the principall cauſes of their Appeale. But leſt that all, euen his blindeſt fooles, ſhould find him to be a poore cauiller in this cauſe againſt M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> he will tell them another coniecture, and that is, that M. <hi>Charn.</hi> ſought occaſion to quarrell with the Archprieſt vpon his firſt entertainement into England. And for proofe hereof he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a piece of a letter, which M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> writ vnto him 24. <hi>May</hi> 1600, of which letter I will ſet ſome part downe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the copie thereof, as I haue ſeene it: <hi>Right Reuerend Sir, being returned into England, I thought it my duety in most humble maner, to ſalute you, hoping my returne cannot be preiudiciall to any your good courſes, and deſiring for your further ſatisfaction, to ſpeake with you, when it ſhall pleaſe you.</hi> This which followeth is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here in the <hi>Apologie. In the meane while to requeſt of you thus much in charitie, to write to me, why ſending for me to declare the authority giuen you by Cardinal</hi> Caietane <hi>his letters, you ſhewed me ſuch inſtructions as when I came to Rome, I found were not annexed to your Commiſsion, as you at that time ſayd were annexed.</hi> Thus far in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and then toward the latter end: <hi>Reuerend Sir, a ſmall reaſon from you ſhall giue me ſatisfaction: for mine intention is not to argue any matters with you, but to take your anſwere ſimply, as you ſhall giue it, and reſt therein ſatisfied. And this ſcruple being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, I ſhall the more confidently deale with you in other matters which I am to impart vnto you. Thus wiſhing nothing more then peace and quietneſſe amongſt vs, I ceaſe to trouble you from your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable affaires, and doe expect ſome anſwere from you at your beſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:5209:156"/> 24. of May.</hi> But of this hath this <hi>Apologie</hi> maker culled as much as is here noted: which part if it were taken alone by it ſelfe, could not imply a quarrel in any honeſt mans iudgement, much leſſe when it is taken with all theſe circumſtances. But this author muſt either adde ſomewhat ſtill to that which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or curtall it: or els he wil ſhame himſelfe. And as for that which M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> affirmed in his letter, it is confirmed by an other, although the Archprieſts ſecretary gaue M. <hi>Charnock</hi> the lie fiue or ſixe times in the anſwere to his letter, which how wel ſoeuer it ſuteth with the new religious managing of matters, did not ſo well become a prieſt to a prieſt: neither hath M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> ſo behaued himſelfe, but that his credit alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other witneſſe may be thought as good as M <hi>Blackwels,</hi> or this idle authors, although he doth not enuie their worſhips calling. But marke I pray you how this matter would be here ſalued. <hi>The Archprieſt denieth that euer hee ſayd, that they</hi> (the fained inſtructions) <hi>were expreſly in his inſtructions from Rome.</hi> By which it may be gathered, that the Archprieſt did at the leaſt propoſe ſuch matters, as were not in his inſtructions, which were ſent from Rome. But this is not the matter wherewith he is charged, that he ſhould vſe theſe particular words: but hee is charged directly, that pretending to ſhewe the inſtructions which were annexed to his Commiſſion, hee ſhewed ſuch as were not annexed thereunto. And being taken in the manner he confeſſed aſmuch. And who ſeeth not what a poore ſhift this is, <hi>the Archprieſt denieth that he ſayd they were expreſly in his inſtructions?</hi> who doubteth but that the man ſaith trueth, when anſwering his neighbor who calleth for him vſeth theſe words, <hi>I ſay, I am not at home,</hi> although he be at home? For although it be falſe <hi>that he is not at home,</hi> yet it is very true that <hi>he ſayth hee is not at home.</hi> And with this ieſt doth this fellow ſalue this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>the Archprieſt denieth that hee ſayd that they were expreſly in his inſtructions.</hi> Who euer charged him that he ſhould vſe theſe words? Theſe poore ſhifts may blinde ſuch as willingly will be blinde, and other men will ſoone diſcouer the fallacy. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation was and is, that pretending to ſhew his inſtructions, which his Commiſſion mentioned, to be annexed vnto it, hee drew out falſe things, which were neuer annexed to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:5209:157"/> and he was taken in the maner. And this is it which both M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> and M. <hi>Colington</hi> will iuſtifie, &amp; many more ſuch goodly matters, if need ſhall require, where theſe poore trickes wil not ſerue to any purpoſe, <hi>I ſay not thus or thus expreſly.</hi> Now follow certaine exceptions againſt ſome letters written by certaine prieſts in <hi>Wisbich</hi> vnto the Archprieſt. I haue not ſeene the copies to my remembrance, and therefore can ſay nothing of them more then this, that it is not incredible, that the Archprieſt would giue cauſe of ſharper words then are there vſed. But all ſerueth to prooue ſomewhat, namely, <hi>what courſe was held by the troubleſome, eſpecially after M.</hi> Charnockes <hi>returne into England.</hi> But there is not one worde, what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of miſrule did before M. <hi>Charnock</hi> returned into England, or what cauſe they did giue of theſe troubles, to wit, the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſlander of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and ſuch vile imputations, as the priſoners might accordingly haue written to the Archprieſt in other termes, then <hi>peripſema tuum.</hi> There muſt not be a word of this matter which made all the ſtirre: for ſayth this fellow with ſhame enough <hi>(ca. 8 fol. 115.) of the other point of ſchiſme we will not talke at all, and wee are ſory that euer it was mentioned or brought in queſtion: vnquiet people hauing taken occaſion hereby to continue contention, and to make more brables then were needfull.</hi> How eaſie a matter had it been then for this author to haue ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this queſtion propoſed in this tenth chapter <hi>fol 148. Which part hath broken the peace,</hi> ſince that he doth acknowledge, that the bringing of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> in queſtion was the cauſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and could not be ignorant, who brought it againe in queſtion, being tolde ſo often that the Ieſuites did it; and the Archprieſt both before and after the peace was made, and the Archprieſt his letter was cited for proofe thereof in the booke to his Holines pag. 63, and in the booke to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> pag. 60? But this author muſt haue his Readers eares filled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtories, ſuch as are impertinent to his queſtion. And when he thinketh that his Reader hath forgotten the matter which he propoſed: then he ſlinketh away, and beginneth afreſh with ſome other which he handleth as wiſely.</p>
               <p>But to make an end of this Chapter: here are certaine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inſerted of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> exhorting to peace, as though <hi>F. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:5209:157"/> tricks were not knowen very well. If this author could haue brought forth any of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> letters to his fellow <hi>F.

Iones</hi> the Ieſuits, who were the chiefe maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that ſenſeleſſe Libel <hi>of ſchiſme</hi> againſt the prieſts, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to retract their ſcandalous opinions, to correct their forwardneſſe in inſuring Catholique prieſts, to exhort them to make ſatisfaction for their vnchriſtian detractions: ſuch letters would haue bene for <hi>F. Parſons</hi> credit. But to cite a letter, or exhortation to the prieſts iniuried, to haue peace: what doeth it argue but an obdurate malice in him, and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſire, that they ſhould deſiſt from that, to which they were bound in conſcience, to wit, the defence of their fame, and the clearing themſelues from ſuch falſe, but moſt wicked impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of <hi>ſchiſme, rebellion,</hi> and whatſoeuer a miſchieuous head could deuiſe, and ſpred abroad againſt them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo finally</hi> (ſaith this author) <hi>after all their former reſiſtance, and appeales aſwell of</hi> D. Bagſhaw <hi>and his fellows at</hi> Wisbich, <hi>as of</hi> M.

Charnocks</hi> appeale was preſented and proſecuted in Rome, before this booke came foorth: and this author could not be ignorant thereof, if I am not miſtaken in him) <hi>which yet they ought to haue done within certaine moneths, vnder paine that all is voyd if it be not done.</hi> But how many are theſe certaine moneths? The Lawyers ſay 13. moneths, if we ſhall count them by the moneths: and vpon iuſt cauſe 26. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths from the Appeale, within which time doubtleſſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> heard of the Appellants at Rome. And Launcelot l. 4. <hi>Inſtit. Iuris Canon. de appellationibus cap. accidit.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, Yet a longer time might haue bene granted for the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:5209:158"/> proſecution of an Appeale: But as I thinke no man doeth now doubt, but that the prieſts had intention to follow their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, and will giue this cauſe of their publiſhing of books, <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente lite,</hi> that is, <hi>while the controuerſies hang:</hi> for that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt (notwithſtanding their Appeale) denounced them to haue incurred the cenſures, &amp; loſt their faculties, becauſe they ſubſcribed to a thing called <hi>an Appeale,</hi> &amp; he kept a fowle ſtirre by ſome of his ſeditious Agents againſt the Appellants. An other reaſon was, becauſe they had a deſire that their cauſe ſhould be knowen ſufficiently abroad, which could not bee knowen too much in their conceit, who ſought nothing but a trial of the trueth, and for iuſtice againſt their vniuſt defamers. But what this author hath to ſay againſt theſe bookes, you ſhal heare in the next Chapter: and if you wil haue an anſwere from him to this queſtion propoſed <hi>fol. 148. which part hath broken the peace,</hi> you muſt goe picke it vp where you can, now you know his worſhips minde.</p>

But where were theſe godly conſiderations, when this libell, ſo ſenſleſſe, falſe, and ſcandalous, was written and publiſhed? how was God offended hereby, or was hee not in your pious wiſdome? were any cenſures incurred hereby of the Church, or any puniſhments deſerued which the ciuill lawe inflicteth vpon Libellers? In whom was that <hi>baſe and wicked ſpirit,</hi> againſt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:5209:159"/> which you ſo godly inueigh in this place, when Ieſuites, the Archprieſt, and their faction were authours, ſpreaders, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouers of ſuch things? where were theſe godly meditations, when the Archprieſt after the peace made did ſpread and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue that ſcandalous libell, or <hi>reſolution</hi> (as hee termed it) from the <hi>mother citie,</hi> that the refuſers of the appointed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, were <hi>ſciſmaticks?</hi> I will omit to ſpeake of that <hi>baſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirit,</hi> which caried certain gentlemen from houſe to houſe (as he doeth the mountebanks from towne to towne) with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine libels againſt particular men, where they ſeeme to ſtriue whether they can excell thoſe mountebanks in ſhameleſſe and vngracious relations. I will here ſay nothing of that <hi>baſe and wicked ſpirit,</hi> which maketh euery one of the factious adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the Ieſuits and Archprieſt, a moſt infamous and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libeller againſt ſuch prieſts, as did delay to accept of the Archpr. before they ſaw iuſt cauſe, and denyed afterward that they had bene <hi>ſchiſmatickes</hi> during the time of that delay. I will not vrge this fellow his <hi>Manifeſtation of ſpirits,</hi> in which all his holines (which he pretendeth many other wayes) is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be nothing but hypocriſie. I will onely ſtand vpon this <hi>Apologie,</hi> in which I haue ſhewed, and ſhall yet diſcouer ſo many falſhoods and ſlanders, as no man of indifferencie can deny, but that it is a moſt <hi>notorious libell,</hi> and proceeded of a moſt <hi>baſe and wicked ſpirit.</hi> And ſo I will leaue it to the authour his own iudgement here giuen, <hi>what ſinne it is to libell, how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in the ſight of God and man, and how great cenſures and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame puniſhments are due</hi> vnto him for it, when hee ſhall come to his anſwere, as the prieſts haue bene in the face of the whole world: which in the opinion of all learned men, hath freed their bookes from the ignominious name of libels.</p>
               <p>But here are certaine circumſtances, which aggrauate the matter againſt the prieſts: as firſt, that <hi>a religious communitie is here defamed:</hi> but this is falſe, for the ſocietie is not touched by the prieſts, but certaine men of the ſociety, ſuch as we hope the whole ſociety will not beare out in their wicked courſes. And if they ſhould beare them out therein, and thereby make themſelues a party, then muſt the <hi>religious community</hi> expect no other priuiledge, then any other irreligious company. And
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:5209:159"/> I cannot but marueile, how M.D. <hi>Ely</hi> in this Epiſtle to M. <hi>D.W.</hi> (prefixed to his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie</hi>) blameth the Prieſts for oppoſing themſelues (as he miſtaketh them) againſt the whole ſociety: for they haue not in all their bookes vſed any ſuch generall termes, as may include the whole bodie of the ſocietie when they haue ſpoken of Ieſuits: but in handling par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matters haue ſufficiently diſcouered whom they haue ment, when they haue ſpoken of Ieſuits, yea they haue in plain termes, and particularly affirmed, and publiſhed in print, that they doe not touch the body of the ſocietie, but ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, as may be ſeene in their preface to the booke dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Inquiſition, pag 5.</hi> where they make this proteſtation, <hi>Neque quae de ſocietate hîc dicentur, in vniuerſam ſocietatem dicta velimus, cui tantum tribuimus quantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eius virtus, &amp; doctrina poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, hic tantum particulares quorundam actiones conquerimur, &amp;c. Neither will we, that what is ſaid here of the ſociety, be ſaid of the whole ſociety, to which we doe attribute as much as their vertue and learning deſerue, we doe complaine here of the particular actions of ſome onely, &amp;c.</hi> And as it ſhould ſeeme, this matter troubleth the authour of this <hi>Apologie</hi> much more, as it is againſt a fewe Ieſuits, then as it is againſt all the reſt, which cauſeth himſelfe ſtill to forget himſelfe, or his matter rather, when any occaſion occurreth as it doth often to ſpeake of the Ieſuits, and here he runneth along after them with theſe admirations, <hi>what manner of people they bee for diuers reſpects, that are here diſcouered,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not the ſame men, which are here diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>and of what account with our very enemies themſelues,</hi> of what other then hypocrites, matchiuilians and traitors to their Countrey? <hi>ſome of them being Superiours</hi> (as euery pariſh in London hath ſcholemaſters, yea and ſome in hier offices) <hi>ſome of ſingular merit towards the common cauſe,</hi> ſuch cauſe perhaps, as to which the infamie of Catholike prieſts muſt bee iudged moſt neceſſary: <hi>others notorious for their knowen vertues,</hi> how gladly would <hi>blind Hugh</hi> ſee ſome of them here in England, for then, neither ſhould the good haue cauſe to grieue, nor the bad bee conformed in their naughty courſe, who ſeeing the ſuppoſed beſt to be ſo bad, they doe raſhly coniecture, that there is none good, for which folly of theirs, they and their
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:5209:160"/> bad guides muſt anſwere at the laſt day, and ſmart long before, vnleſſe they repent themſelues while they haue time to repent. Thus much concerning this authours conceite of the ſinne of libelling retorted vpon himſelfe and his partners in this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> and other his Libels, which he will neuer be able to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Now follow his exceptions againſt the two bookes, which he termeth Libels, wherin he purpoſeth to diſcouer <hi>foule faults</hi> to haue bene, as <hi>falſhood, deceite, malice and ſlanderous calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Alwayes prouided, that whereas the Reader hath ſtill expected, and liued in hope to ſee ſomewhat to the purpoſe, now he muſt take this colde comfort to be remitted backe to the Chapters before handled for a larger proofe of what is to be ſayd. Firſt hee beginneth with the latine booke, which is dedicated to his Holineſſe, whoſe title is, <hi>Declaratio motuum, &amp;c. A declaration of the ſturres and troubles that haue riſen in England betweene the Ieſuits on the one ſide, together with M.</hi> G. Blackwel <hi>Archpriest in all things fauouring them, and the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſts on the other ſide, from the death of Cardinall</hi> Allen <hi>of pious memory, vnto this yeere 1601. In this very title</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and firſt page 5. or 6. abuſes and ſleights and ſhifts may be noted to be vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Holineſſe &amp;c. for first whereas the whole world knoweth, that their controuerſie is with the Archprieſt as appeareth by their Appellation to his Holines, an. 1600. 17.</hi> Nouemb. <hi>and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that their ſtomacke againſt the Ieſuits is for ſtanding with him, and for as by the whole diſcourſe of both theſe bookes appeareth, here they change the whole controuerſie, and do ſay, that it is with the Ieſuits and M.</hi> Blackwell, <hi>that fauoureth them ſo as he is put here, but as an</hi> Appendix <hi>in the cauſe which is plaine falſhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt fault which is found in the Latin booke: &amp; all things conſidered, it wil not proue a <hi>fault,</hi> much leſſe ſo <hi>foule</hi> as this author would it ſhould ſeeme to be: the appellation was made from the Archp. &amp; not from the Ieſuits, becauſe appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made from ſuch only, as are and take vpon them to be ſuperiors. Such are not the Ieſuits ouer the Secular prieſts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth the appealing from the Archpr. cleare the Ieſuits, who in the appellation it ſelfe are proued to be the chiefe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of all theſe broyles, as all the world may ſee in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. And he doeth very falſly affirme that the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:5209:160"/> ſheweth no other, as himſelfe can remember, when he liſteth: Namely in his table prefixed to his <hi>Apologie num. 23.</hi> where he citeth this ſentence out of his <hi>Latine</hi> booke pag. 30. <hi>Ieſuitae &amp;c. The Ieſuits diſpairing to be able to get ſuperioritie to themſelues by way of voyces or ſuffrages</hi> (of the prieſts) <hi>and on the other ſide hating and flying to admit epiſcopall dignitie</hi> (into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) <hi>thought to procure dominion to themſelues vnder the maske of an other mans perſon, &amp;c.</hi> Hath this fellow now forgotten what his owne iudgement was there of the prieſts their conceit of this matter? hath not he perſwaded his reader, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and onely ground of this our preſent contention, and ſcandalous controuerſie, is the very ſame diſeaſe of <hi>emulation</hi> partly of Lay men againſt prieſts, and partly of prieſts againſt religious men, <hi>eſpecially the Fathers of the Societie, with whom at this preſent they haue to doe? Apol. cap. 1. fol. 2.</hi> And would he now haue his reader beleeue, that the whole world knoweth the contrary, and that it is not principally againſt the Ieſuits? And whereas it is here ſaid that the Archpr. is put as <hi>an Appendix,</hi> ſome indeed doe thinke, that he hath bound himſelfe Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Ieſuits: but I doe not heare that the prieſts do talke of th'one or th'other.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>foule fault</hi> which here is found is, that the prieſts of the Seminaries reſiding in England, are put for the oppoſite part, of which, ſaith he, <hi>theſe contentions are not the twentieth part, and this is proued by their owne confeſsions, in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Perchance this fellow hath relation to the queſtion made to <hi>M Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke, How many they did certainely know to approue this their miſsion, and to be priuie to the matters, that ſhould be propoſed, &amp;c. Chap 9. Apol. 131.</hi> To which theſe prieſts made their anſwere according to their owne certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which anſwere is there deceitfully inſerted, as hath bene ſhewed, and is here as deceitfully againe brought by him for his purpoſe, their confeſſions being, that there were <hi>Quàm plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſacerdotes, Very many priests,</hi> as appeareth where <hi>M. Charnocks</hi> examination is ſet downe <hi>fol. 130,</hi> which he there proued by certaine letters, which he brought with him, which teſtified as much. And by their anſwer of their certaine knowledge, which they could not haue, but by preſent or particuler letter: this
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:5209:161"/> fellow taketh a ſilly aduantage to proue that they were not the 20. part by their owne confeſſion. The prieſts did call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues prieſts of the Seminaries, becauſe they were ſo, and by this name are diſtinguiſhed from the Ieſuits, who are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall faction againſt them, and are prieſts, who ſooner or later for the moſt part did forſake the Seminaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, they ſay in this title</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that their contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ieſuits began from the death of</hi> Card. Allen. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther challenge vnto themſelues any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, neither doe they ſay when any begun, but onely intituled the booke in this maner, <hi>A declaration of ſtirres and troubles which are or were betweene the Ieſuits and them, ſince the death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, vnto ſuch a yeere.</hi> If a man ſhould write of the warres in the Low Countreys from the death of the Prince of Parma, vntill this preſent yeere, muſt he be ſaid to affirme, that the warres began then? yet cannot this author proue, that there was any publique oppoſition, or common ſtirres in England before the Cardinals death: but that rather what was begunne, (as he ſaith <hi>Cap. 2. fol. 85.</hi> in the Cardinals time by Libertines, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious people,) was retained ſomewhat from breaking forth by his authority while he liued, and this is moſt true: for the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits who luſted after a ſuperioritie ouer the prieſts, were afraid to make this their pride knowen, either by themſelues, or by their factious adherents, ſo long as he liued; But the good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall being dead in the yeere 94, all factious brake out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Fa. Weſton</hi> the Ieſuit, and his factions begun a common wealth in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and vnder a colour of a ſtricter rule, all the prieſts there muſt become his ſubiects, or liue in perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, ſome Ieſuits abroad tooke order for the prieſts their welcome to all ſuch places, whither they were not directed by them. The matters of Rome I leaue to them to whom that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, and although this fellow is ſo impudent, as to alledge the Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> his letter to proue that ſome of the ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (as he termeth them) had begunne to ſtirre againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in England in his dayes, his reader may eaſily diſcouer his falſhood if he will turne (not to the place by him cited, to wit, the 4. Chapter, for there is nothing to be ſeene) but to the ſecond Chapter, for there he ſhall finde that the prieſts are no
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:5209:161"/> more charged for any ſtirre againſt the Ieſuits, then the Ieſuits for their ſedition againſt the prieſts, and moreouer that what difference there was, could not be but ſome priuate quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſome priuate man, and not any ſuch publique diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or diſlike, as this is of which the booke intreated which was dedicated to his Holines, as I haue ſhewed where this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet downe by this author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly they ſaid, Ad S. D. N.</hi> Clementem <hi>8. exhibita ab ipſis ſacerdotibus, that this declaration was exhibited by the Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to our most holy father Pope</hi> Clement <hi>the 8.</hi> This word <hi>was</hi> is of his owne addition. It is ſaid to be exhibited, in that it was preſently to be ſent by them; And if it came not to his Holines his hands ſo ſoone as they intended, the fault was not in them who tooke all ſuch meanes for it as they could, ſo that they might iuſtly vſe the phraſe, which they did, without deſeruing any blame therefore. And the prieſts are ſaide to exhibite it themſelues, for that they writ it, and were to preſent it in their owne names, and the not comming of it to his Holines view will iuſtifie their printing of many copies, that ſome one, by one or other, might come into his hands, and the ſhameleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this fellow may the more now appeare, who would ſo peremptorily informe his reader, that the prieſts were loth, that he ſhould know of it (hauing by printing taken a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way for it) and much lother to anſwere it before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the whole world will witnes for them, that they haue bene to anſwere it. The fifth cauill is at the ſentence of Scripture, which the prieſts put to their books, as though they had abuſed it in vſing it in that place; But gald nagges muſt haue pardon, if being touched they winch. The iuſtneſſe of the prieſts their cauſe, will beare them out againſt all hereticks, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits, and Atheiſts, and will ſtop the mouthes of them, how potent ſoeuer they either are, or would ſeeme to be among their like. Thus much is implied in that ſentence, and no leſſe was in the prieſts their meaning when they prefixed it to their Booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly and laſtly it is ſaid in this firſt page</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that it was printed</hi> Rhotomagi <hi>apud Iacobum, &amp;c. At Roane in France in the houſe of Iames, &amp;c.</hi> And hereupon he keepeth ſuch a foule ſtirre,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:5209:162"/> as if it had beene a whole halfepenny matter, where the booke had bene printed, or that the Pope might haue thought the prieſts cauſe to be the more iuſt, if the booke were printed at Roane. I pray you good ſir tell me, what doeth the being here or there printed, helpe or hinder the matter in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? what if it be printed at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or at <hi>Coſmop?</hi> If this fellow could ſhew what auaile may come to the prieſts, or what preiudice to the other part, by hauing their booke goe forth as printed at <hi>Roane,</hi> he might haue beſtowed a little of his paines, taken here about it, to ſome good purpoſe: but his exception beeing ſo abſurd as it is, I will turne him to the Printers boy to reaſon this matter with him, who, for any thing that I can as yet learne, ſet this (which he citeth) to the booke, and the boy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this fellow ſome equall match for him, will perchance ſpurre him this queſtion, Why he ſhould conſter <hi>Rhotomagi, Printed at Roane,</hi> rather then to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olde at <hi>Roane;</hi> or why hee ſhould interprete <hi>Rhotomagi, at Roane in France,</hi> rather then at <hi>Roane</hi> in England, there being in England diuers places na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by as ſtrange names as <hi>Roane</hi> is, as <hi>Scotland, Iury, litle Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and ſuch like; yea the little boy will remember perchance that ſome of <hi>F. P.</hi> bookes, which were printed here in England, are ſaid to haue bene printed at <hi>Doway,</hi> and yet I trow this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not ſay for a hundred pound, that <hi>F. P.</hi> can <hi>lye,</hi> or at the leaſt, that hee <hi>abuſed</hi> any man in ſaying ſo. But I will leaue this authour and the Printers boy together, for they ſeeme to be very well coupled to argue this matter: onely I wiſh, that this author would beware, what termes he doeth vſe in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for it may be, the Printer will call him twice or thrice by his name, if he be miſcalled himſelfe, or perchance the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or his boy will tell him, that there are as good Printers in London as in <hi>Roane,</hi> although they themſelues were not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and put him to a <hi>nonplus,</hi> for ſaying, that the booke was printed vnder the protection of my L. of London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well then</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>theſe ſixe abſurdities, ſhifts, and falſhoods, being diſcouered in the very firſt page of the booke, as a preamble to the reſt, and vſed euen to his Holines himſelfe, we may imagine what the remnant will be.</hi> The reader may imagine, that it is not worth the ſtooping for, which this man letteth lye, if it be not too
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:5209:162"/> hot, or too heauy for him, as here alſo he excepteth againſt the prieſts their printing of their bookes: <hi>notwithstanding the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall which may grow by the comming abroad of theſe diſſenſions:</hi> to which, anſwere is made, that they muſt looke to it, who driue the prieſts to this courſe, hauing no other way left for them to recouer their fame, which was moſt iniuriouſly taken away from them. Hee excepteth alſo againſt that which is ſaid of Card. <hi>Allen</hi> his fauour towards the prieſts, which hee ſayth <hi>he hath refuted in the third and fourth Chapter,</hi> in which this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath committed (as often he doeth in this kinde) a more groſſe fault, then if he had ſaid, that his booke had beene prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Roane in France:</hi> for this would haue troubled none, but ſome cauilling foole: and theſe trickes to referre his reader ſo often to ſuch places, where he ſhall find nothing of that matter for which he is ſent hither, may trouble euen his <hi>gentle readers</hi> patience. Well yet you muſt goe looke in the third Chapter for a matter, which is not there touched by him: there is in the fourth Chapter ſome proofe, that the Cardinal diſliked ſome actions, in which were ſome temporall men, and ſome prieſts, long agoe, many yeeres before theſe ſtirres began, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long nothing to the controuerſie now in queſtion, which is, <hi>whether the prieſts were ſchiſmatickes,</hi> who deferred to accept the Archpr. before they did ſee the <hi>Breue,</hi> or to theſe priuat quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, of which it ſeemeth (by a letter of his ſet in the ſecond Chapter) he was informed before his death: or thirdly to the ſtirres which the Ieſuits began in the Colledge about the ſame time. To conclude, there is nothing recited there, which is here affirmed; neither is that which is laid to Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> his chalenging of <hi>legantine</hi> power in England any way ſolued, but in this manner: <hi>and this is all the difference, that euer was betweene F.</hi> Heywood <hi>and F. Parſons:</hi> as if the queſtion had beene, which is the way to Poplington? yea there is as much confeſſed, as F. <hi>Heywood</hi> was charged with for the particulars, as any man may ſee in this 164. leafe. The readers muſt go looke here and there for diuers other matters: but D. <hi>Haddocke</hi> and M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> are here to be defended by the author, for that poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which they made vnto the two prieſts. Indeede theſe good Proctors came vnto the two prieſts within two dayes, or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:5209:163"/> three of their arriuall at Rome, and were ſo hote with them, as M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> ſtirred not out of his chamber aboue a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after: he had bene all that while poſſeſſed with an ague, which ſome of his friends ſaid, that hee had before hee tooke that heate, but a ſudden ioy perchance, that the two prieſts were that day to be apprehended, put life and health into him vpon the ſeaſt day of <hi>S. Tho.</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and made him come abroad: and what theſe Proctors did after, at the apparance of the two prieſts, I haue before ſhevved, and vvhat M. <hi>Martin</hi> vvrit into England thereof.</p>
               <p>The particulars which touch theſe Proctors their perſons I know not, and therefore I leaue it vnto them to declare, who thought it expedient to make them know in this cauſe: yet doe I not well vnderſtand, how there was <hi>any affinitie</hi> between Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Allen</hi> and D. <hi>Haddocke</hi> (which this fellow will needes haue for the Doctors credit) neither of them hauing bene at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time married, and I haue heard that M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> was extraordinarily fauoured by Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> by whom he was admoniſhed to depart out of England, before ſome matters ſhould chance, which would ſhortly chance, and would be ſome let to his paſſage: which kinde of vſage at that time, to wit, when the great trouble was in the yeere 1586. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layd together with his being then ſet at liberty, might giue ſuſpition to ſome, that all was not as it ſhould haue been, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in times of leſſe trouble ſome men haue found the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor by extraordinary meanes to haue their liberty at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſome great men, or ſome highly fauoured friends. Now followeth his defence of M. <hi>Standiſh,</hi> and diuers other. And whereas the prieſts haue ſet downe in their bookes, that Maſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> had giuen his name to become a Ieſuite, and therefore no fit man to deale for them in the procuring of this <hi>ſubordination,</hi> which is pretended to haue been made, to take vp controuerſies, which were between Ieſuits and prieſts, as <hi>cap. 8. fol. 124.</hi> this author affirmeth, or prieſts and prieſts, and yet was the principall inſtrumentas is wel knowen to all men) and it is confeſſed in the ſame chapter <hi>fol. 98.</hi> and <hi>99:</hi> this author letteth that goe without any word to the contrary, for intrueth he cannot denie it, and taketh occaſion to ſay ſomewhat, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:5209:163"/> that which the prieſts affirme of M. <hi>Standiſh,</hi> that is, that he did vſe the name of the prieſts, as if he had been ſent by the prieſts, whereas indeed he was not, and that he himſelfe ſayd at his returne (in the hearing of diuers prieſts, who will iuſtifie it) <hi>that he had their interpretatiue conſent, and that hee preſumed</hi> that they would conſent to that which he did. But when this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor commeth to prooue, that M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> did nothing without the prieſts their conſent, in the procuring of this <hi>Subordination,</hi> he returneth his reader to the eighth Chapter for diuers prieſts letters, which already I haue ſhewed were all written after that this <hi>Subordination</hi> was made, which argueth a notable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in this authour, that hee will ſo peremptorily affirme, whatſoeuer may ſound any way in the eares of thoſe, whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection blindeth, to make for his purpoſe, although in the Iudgement of the indifferent hee worketh his confuſion. For other diſproofe alſo of M. <hi>Blackwels,</hi> and the Cardinall <hi>Caietans</hi> ignorance in our Engliſh affaires, his Reader muſt goe backe to the eighth and ninth Chapter: he ſendeth alſo his Reader to the third Chapter, to ſee how falſly the Ieſuites are ſayd to ſeeke their owne, and that they trouble the peace of England, and perſecute more then heretikes. To the which it hath been anſwered, that they doe ſeeke their owne in ſome ſort, for ſo much, as <hi>pride</hi> and what els followeth thereon, may be called theirs, and that alſo it might bee ſayd that they ſeeke <hi>quae Ieſu Chriſti,</hi> (as this author doth there challenge) <hi>thoſe things which are belonging to Ieſu Chriſt:</hi> for ſo much, as the almes of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes for reliefe of prieſts and other Catholikes may bee ſaide to belong to Ieſu Chriſt; and that they labour by infamie to ſeduce the Catholike Laitie from that loue, and reuerence, which they owe vnto Catholike prieſts, which is a perſecution againſt the prieſts more grieuous, then any that hath been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any heretikes againſt them. For whereas there hath been a moſt charitable correſpondence betweene the Catholike Laytie and the prieſts: now the world is come to this paſſe, that he is no zealous or godly Catholike, that will not runne from place to place to diſgrace all ſuch prieſts as refuſe to be guided by the Ieſuits, or in this preſent controuerſie will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they liued in <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and deſerued eternall ſhame
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:5209:164"/> and reproch, becauſe they deferred their obedience to an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, vntill they did ſee, what was their Superiour his will concerning it: at what time they all ſubmitted themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly, whatſoeuer this author moſt wickedly ſuggeſteth to his reader in this place, without any proofe at all, vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his moſt abſurd ſurmizes; for which alſo he ſendeth his reader to the former chapter, where he ſhal ſee <hi>perhaps,</hi> and <hi>as it is ſuppoſed,</hi> and <hi>it is very likely,</hi> and ſuch like ſtuffe, as a man who eſteemed of his credit would be aſhamed of in ſo weighty a matter. And for his fooliſh aſſertion, that if it had been vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would haue wrought ſome permanent effect, there is an old ſaying, that there muſt goe two words to a bargaine, and ſo ſay I, that if there muſt be peace betweene two parts, both the parts muſt doe their parts to preſerue it: for who ſeeth not that it is a moſt abſurd ieſt, that if peace be broken by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the one part, the other ſhould be blamed for not dealing ſincerely, and vnfainedly? the prieſts haue ſayd, that the Ieſuits and the Archprieſt did breake the peace, and they haue ſhewed how, and that which they haue ſayd herein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be controlled, and that is, that <hi>Fa Iones</hi> the Ieſuit, after the peace made, fetched out of hell it ſelfe (as by the euent it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) that moſt wicked paradox of his fellow Ieſuit <hi>Fa. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> concerning <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and the Archprieſt alſo after the peace made, brake the ſame peace by publiſhing a <hi>reſolution</hi> from the <hi>mother citie,</hi> that the refuſers of the appointed authority were <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> which <hi>reſolution</hi> he affirmed he had either from <hi>F. Warford,</hi> or <hi>Fa Tichborne,</hi> a paire of yong Engliſh Ieſuites, and this is the Epiſtle which is not onely mentioned, but ſet downe in the booke to his Holines pag 63, and which this author ſlily ouerſlippeth, and ſtoppeth his readers mouth with the margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal note, which is put by the prieſt, to wit; <hi>origo &amp;c. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new contention was a violent Epiſtle of the Archpriests,</hi> which here this author citeth, and runneth in his new found milde and religious tearmes vpon the prieſts; becauſe they would breake out for an angry Epiſtle, and ſo laughing in his ſleeue, to thinke how hee can couſin the <hi>blind obedient,</hi> which muſt beleeue any thing that he telleth them, he ſhutteth vp this matter, without telling them what this angry Epiſtle was,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:5209:164"/> or that it was ſet downe in the booke to his Holineſſe, leaſt that he ſhould haue diſcouered the weakenes of his cauſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his owne wickednes, who in ſo weake a caſe would vſe ſo wicked tearmes againſt Catholike prieſts.</p>
               <p>This you ſee how this fellow hath anſwered the booke which is dedicated to his Hol. and what poore geere he picketh out, ſometime out of the diſcourſe, ſometime out of the margent, and letteth this diſcourſe goe quietly by him, and with all this niceneſſe, and choice of ſome place, to which he might make colourable ſhewe of anſwere, he bringeth nothing, but what being examined will breede his owne ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Appeale (he ſaith) ſhalbe anſwered by the Pope, who in a briefe of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt. 1601.</hi> refuſed it for peace ſake, as there is ſaid, being induced thereunto perchance by ſuch, as were loath to heare theſe matters come in queſtion: yet ſince this <hi>Breue,</hi> all the world is made a witneſſe, that theſe matters haue bene handled at Rome, and that there was iuſt cauſe to appeale notwithſtanding the fine gloſes here made by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who wiſheth perchance by this time that he had not ſo much commended this Pope.</p>
               <p>Laſtly he agitateth a letter of M. <hi>Muſh</hi> his writing to <hi>Mon Seignior Morto,</hi> a Biſhop in Italy who was ioyned with Doctor <hi>Lewes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſſana</hi> in many affaires of the Church: which letter is ſaid in the prieſts their bookes, to haue bene ſent by the two meſſengers vnto him. And in reaſon the Prieſts (who ſaid ſo) ſhould haue had credit, vntill the contrary could haue bene prooued (which can neuer be) with more ſubſtantiall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then are here brought: To wit, <hi>it was not found among their papers,</hi> as though they (hauing bene 17. dayes in Rome, before that the <hi>Ieſuites and the Sbirri</hi> carried them to priſon) could not conuey it (as it was directed) before that their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were ſeazed on, or ſecondly <hi>the two meſſengers neuer ſpake to</hi> Fa. Parſons <hi>of ſuch a letter, ergo</hi> they caried no ſuch letter with them, as though <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> were the man, that muſt knowe all things, and was not rather kept ſo ſhort, as diuers in the Citie noted, how he was troubled for that he could get no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of the prieſts to his curious queſtion, then that <hi>time and place</hi> ſhould diſcouer what they had to ſay. And although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:5209:165"/> he was admitted by them to be their examiner, it was not without the condition, that they ſhould not be bound to anſwere to his queſtions, which condition the Fiſcall did take, and agree vnto, before he could obteine of them to let <hi>Fa. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> be the examiner: and it may be thought, that when they were asked ſuch idle queſtions, they did vſe this licenſe, or their owne rights, no oath in this kind binding any man to anſwere to all things propoſed vnto them, and <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> may call to minde, if it pleaſe him, that to ſome queſtions he was directly denied an anſwere. The matters contained in <hi>M. Muſh</hi> his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are there ſo ſufficiently handled, as this authour ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof in this place, but referreth his reader backe to fome places already handled, and anſwered; he glaunceth at that which is there ſaid of the neceſſity of the ſacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in England, for which all the Catholikes (if they will) may ſee his egerneſſe againſt their good and comfort in this time of perſecution, that he cannot heare of any who ſhal ſay it is neceſſary, but he is ſtraight on his iacke for it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one ſaid once that it was <hi>either moſt neceſſary in time of perſecution, or a vaine, and as a ſuperfluous ceremony in Gods Church,</hi> becauſe there onely is the proper vſe thereof, he playeth vpon the latter words, as if they had bene affirmed by any one, and applyeth them to ſuch as ſpeake for the neceſſitie of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He excepteth alſo againſt that which <hi>M. Muſh</hi> affirmeth of <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> his State bookes, and is agreeued, that he onely is named among ſuch as haue written of ſuch a ſubiect. And for the loue he beareth to Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> and other of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſetteth downe in print, what they haue written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch matters, as though their fact did excuſe <hi>Fa Parſons.</hi> but why is <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> onely named? becauſe <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> being onely aliue of thoſe writers, of which <hi>M. Muſh</hi> ſpake, was conſequently more likely then any of the other to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of ſuch matters, and alſo becauſe Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> his bookes of <hi>Titles,</hi> are profeſſedly State bookes, and (beeing writ in fauour more of the Spaniſh faction, then any other) were the more likely to bring affliction vppon Catholikes, (the Spaniardes hauing giuen ſo often attempt to inuade our Countrey.) Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> his dealings with the Studentes in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:5209:165"/> Spaine to come in thoſe Armadoes, are euident proofes of his meaning, and conſequently his bookes might be iudged moſt hurtfull to Catholikes. This author alſo would perſwade his reader, that there was ſome great matters betweene Maſter <hi>Muſh</hi> and M. <hi>Collington,</hi> and others, and that they were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented either with others actions concerning the aſſociation, becauſe they had diuers conceits for the proceeding in it: which ſuſpition ought to be taken away from euery indifferent man, that ſhall vnderſtand, that they all came to a concluſion, what was fit to be done, as in all orderly proceedings it falleth out, where diuers men at the firſt vtter their diuers conceits. <hi>M. Muſh</hi> is alſo here taxed for his letter to F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> which is ſet at the latter end of the Engliſh booke, and the matter is made very holy, that a cow ſhould giue a good ſope of milke, and kicke it downe afterward with her heeles, and ſo hauing commended F <hi>Parſons</hi> for his writings, pertaining to deuotion, and controuerſies, for which, and his good will, as I thinke, all the prieſts doe thanke him, as alſo for what other good deedes he hath done, and for reward pray to God for him to ſend him his grace, this author ſetteth himſelfe to anſwere the Engliſh booke entituled, <hi>The Copies of certaine diſcourſes,</hi> which alſo is here to be defended: but firſt this author is to be told, that he doeth ouer laſh too much, when fol. 171. hee affirmeth, that neither M. <hi>Muſh</hi> nor his fellowes haue euer written any books concerning deuotion, or controuerſies, for they haue written much in both kinds, although they had not that meanes which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had, to ſet them forth: and M. <hi>Muſh</hi> in particular put his pen to paper againſt M. <hi>Bell,</hi> now an enemie, as now hee hath done againſt theſe factious Ieſuits, which haue attempted to trouble Gods Church here in England. This author begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his anſwere to the Engliſh booke with as fooliſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as he tooke to the <hi>Latine,</hi> to wit, <hi>that it is ſaid to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at</hi> Roane: to which the anſwere is already giuen, as alſo to that falſe tale deuiſed by him, that their bookes were printed vnder my L. of London his protection. The Meditation is as fooliſh, which he maketh vpon the ſentence of Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the Engliſh booke, <hi>Dicet piger, &amp;c. The ſlothfull excuſe themſelues, ſaying, there is a Lyon in the way:</hi> which carrieth his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:5209:166"/> ſence with it ſo plaine, that it needeth no ſuch comment as this fellow maketh; it beeing well knowen, that many prieſts and lay men doe ſtand for the Ieſuites and Archprieſt in this their faction againſt the prieſts, which would not if they feared not the like hard meaſure to that, which is meated to the prieſts He ſtumbleth very groſſely at the Preface, and the two firſt letters, with references where his reader ſhould finde them confuted: but there he giueth them ſmall comfort, as may be ſeene: hee would ſeeme a little to canuace <hi>M. Champneys</hi> letter, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and frameth his aduerſary to his minde, finding fault where there was none, as any man may ſee that wil. That which Ma. <hi>Champney</hi> calleth <hi>an extraordinarie authoritie;</hi> this authour turneth it to <hi>an extraordinarie dignitie,</hi> as if the prieſts had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they neuer heard of an <hi>Archprieſt</hi> before. Then he commeth on to prooue the abſolute authoritie of the Pope, to giue the Prieſts a Superiour, which the prieſts did alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as appeareth by their yeelding vnto it when they ſaw his Holines <hi>Breue,</hi> before which time it could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be his Holines order. That which the prieſts alledged out of the Canons, was brought to prooue what was the order of Gods Church, which order was broken by the appointing of a Superiour among prieſts, without their priuitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The letters which are cited in the 8. Chapter to prooue the conſent of the prieſts, or deſire to haue a <hi>ſubordination,</hi> are there ſhewed to haue beene written long after the Archprieſt was appointed by the Cardinall <hi>Caietane.</hi> In fine, M. Do. <hi>Ely</hi> in his notes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Apologie,</hi> doth defend M. <hi>Champney</hi> againſt this Libeller, in ſo ample manner, as it were ſuperfluous to ſay any thing more thereof.</p>
               <p>Next vnto M. <hi>Champney</hi> his letter the prieſts ſet F. <hi>Parſons</hi> his letter to M. <hi>B.</hi> vpon which there is a cenſure by M. <hi>I. B.</hi> which ſorely troubleth this good mans patience, eſpecially for that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> letter is diuided into 24 parts by the cenſurer, <hi>and ſo</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>leapeth from one to the other, forth and backe, referring you now to this, and now to that, &amp;c.</hi> This man knoweth well his owne diſeaſe: hee would goe on ſtill, and tell his reader now this, now that, as it commeth into his head, and if his reader ſhould fall to conferring one place of his diſcourſe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:5209:166"/> then is hee vtterly ſhamed, his ſlie trickes are found, his falſhood is diſcouered, his contradiction laid open, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer an euill cauſe needeth to colour it, is ſhewed to bee in his: yet leſt he ſhould ſeeme to ſay nothing, he will ſhew, that there was a contradiction found in <hi>F. Par.</hi> letter, which he ſayth was no contradiction. And how doth he proue this: <hi>F. P.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that from</hi> May <hi>to</hi> Nouember, <hi>is more then halfe a yeere;</hi> A iolly wiſe ſaying of ſo graue a father. But where, or when did this ſaid ſaw paſſe him? Or how doth this alter the caſe more then if there were but two daies betweene <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Nouember?</hi> The contradiction was, that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> ſaid in his letter, that <hi>no letter had yet appeared from</hi> M. Biſhop, <hi>or</hi> M. Charnocke. And in the ſame letter he confeſſeth that <hi>hee receiued a ſtale letter from</hi> M. Biſhop. The next point for which the cenſurer deſerueth blame is, for that he affirmeth that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> ſaid, that an hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal propoſition was layd to <hi>M. Blackwels</hi> charge, and would not himſelfe affirme ſo much: he knew nor perchance, what <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> meant. <hi>F. Parſons</hi> ſaid it, and <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> muſt proue it. And whereas it is here ſaid, that <hi>M. Biſhop</hi> affirmed it at Rome, and proued it by a heare-ſay from <hi>M. Charnocke,</hi> but <hi>M. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> ſaid nothing of it: I wonder why <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> was not asked the queſtion, but if it had bene ſo, <hi>Ma Charnocke</hi> would haue ſaid ſo vnasked; And ſo he muſt haue done, if he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it: for as it ſeemeth <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> had no will to haue the matter brought in queſtion, and as it is to be thought not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good will he bare either to <hi>M. Charnocke,</hi> or any of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. This author is alſo contented to let goe the 21. reaſons giuen in the cenſure for the iuſtifying of the prieſts their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to admit of the authority before the <hi>Breue</hi> came. His reader muſt take his word, that he hath aſſoiled all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties before: he was a cockiſh ſcholler, that made them, and there is an ende of a lubberlike anſwere to the cenſure, and the 21. reaſons contained therein, and to the particulers alſo, there diſcouered of the two prieſts their entertainment in Rome, and what chanced to them there, and afterwards: to wit, the Ieſuits and the Proctors inpoſtures to giue a pious colour to their wicked actions againſt the two prieſts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But to this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we aske him</hi> (<hi>M.</hi> Biſhop) <hi>againe, is this ſo hainous, or damnable, or vnuſuall a matter to reſtraine a couple of Prieſts, where ſo many complaints had bene written of their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contempt, and of the ſcandall raiſed by their contention, as we haue ſet downe before? And doth not euery Prince thus to greater men then they are, committing them first, and after hearing their cauſe?</hi> To this queſtion I anſwere, that the two Prieſts comming to the Iudge at their great charge, and with great paines (as a winters iourney from England to Rome, will prooue to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man) were not to be thought either that they would runne away, or hide themſelues from the Iudge, neither doth any Prince commit any man, that offereth himſelfe vncalled to his triall, vnleſſe the ſubiect be ſuch, as the King may feare him, that he will raiſe ſtrength againſt him, as may ouerthrow him and iuſtice. How many do we daily ſee, that are ſubiect to the law, euen of life and death, who goe at libertie vpon their friends bonds, that they ſhall appeare before the iudges at the time appointed, to anſwere to what ſhall be pleaded againſt them? Priſons are onely vſed for ſuch, as of whome there is cauſe of feare, that they will not come to their triall. theſe Prieſts came to Rome voluntarily, and being dealt withall very earneſtly by <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> to returne into England with letters from the generall of the Ieſuits and the Protector to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Fathers, and the Archprieſt (himſelfe confeſſeth in his letter of the 9. of <hi>October 1599</hi> which is ſet in this Engliſh booke) it is an argument, that they had no will to ſtart, but to goe forward in the buſineſſe, for which they voluntarily went. But beſides all this, whereas this fellowe talketh of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations giuen againſt them, and citeth in the margent, cap. 9. wee haue prooued, that all theſe letters were written long after that his Holineſſe was induced to reſtraine them:
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:5209:169"/> for as there we haue ſhewed, his Holineſſe was reſolued vpon the 17. of <hi>October</hi> to reſtraine them, and the firſt letters, which are brought there by this authour, and could concerne the two prieſts, were not written vntill the 25. of that moneth, &amp; were to goe to Rome to the Protector, and from him backe againe to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where his Holineſſe lay, and was long before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to reſtraine the two prieſts, as the letters of <hi>F. Bellarmine</hi> (now Cardinall) doe prooue, which are cited by this author in his 9. Chapter 120.</p>

                  <hi>Further</hi> (ſaith this fellow) <hi>we would aske them, Were not they heard afterward ſo much, as they would ſay or write?</hi> No good ſir: for when they demanded the copie of the libell which was put vp againſt them, before the two Cardinals, <hi>Caietane</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe,</hi> by which occaſion was giuen them to ſay and write, they might not haue it. And if their earneſtneſſe to haue that libel to make their anſwere, had not bene ſo great, there would haue wanted matter and cauſe to haue kept them priſoners after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for this was the cauſe why M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againe to priſon, for that he was ouer earneſt (as they ſaid) in this point: and being demanded why M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> was alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there was no cauſe giuen but this, that he and M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> were fellowes, and for good fellowſhip they muſt be kept a while longer in ſeuerall priſons cloſe, as they were before, that neither of them might come to the other, but at the Ieſuites (who were their Iaylors) pleaſure, which within a weeke after this their apparance, were once ſuffered to ſalute ech other, and to recreate themſelues at ſuch ſport as the Students made, but the two prieſts were garded by the Ieſuits M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was garded by <hi>Tremaine,</hi> who was Miniſter, or Vicerector of the College, and <hi>F. Tho. Owen,</hi> who was the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> in the College, and M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> was garded by <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> and <hi>Fa. Tichborne,</hi> who was the Prefect of the ſtudies, and then were theſe caried into the hall, where the Sudents were to recreate themſelues, and were ſet one in the one ſide of the hall, the other in the other ſide betweene their gard, for an houre or more, and afterward were committed, as before: but they were tolde, that this was the beginning of their libertie, yet were they kept cloſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners about ſixe weekes after this: and this I haue ſet downe, as I
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:5209:169"/> finde it written in the ſtory, which I haue ſeene of their vſage, to ſhew that they were not heard, what they would haue ſayd, and written, and that they were committed againe, and kept in priſon, becauſe of their earneſtneſſe to ſay, and write more then their aduerſaries had willed they ſhould. And to this ſecond queſtion, <hi>Had they not their papers brought vnto them, to ſee, reade, and interpret?</hi> I anſwere, that in the time of their examinations, the peticions of the prieſts, which they caried with them, were brought vnto them to ſee, and ſet down in their examinations, what they were, and for what end they brought them, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther papers were euer brought vnto them, neither could they obtaine to ſee any of them, after that they were taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, although they ſtood earneſtly to the deniall of ſome matters, which were ſayd to be in their papers, namely where it was ſaid that they brought a paper with them, which was directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in England, in this manner, <hi>To your L L.</hi> of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery there is enough ſayd in the cenſure pag. 127.128. <hi>Had they not licenſe</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>after all examinations made to goe, and ſpeake with his Holineſſe if they would?</hi> No indeed: For as it is here confeſſed in the <hi>Apologie cap. 9. fol. 134.</hi> M. <hi>Biſhops</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ended 25. <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> 4 <hi>Februarie,</hi> and M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was not ſet at libertie, vntil the 22. of <hi>April</hi> following, nor M. <hi>Charnock</hi> vntil the ſixt of <hi>May,</hi> to wit, two dayes, or three after that M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was commanded away from Rome.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:5209:171"/> a moſt wicked calumniatour: Thus hee beginneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By no one thing more doe we thinke our diſcontented and deceiued brethren, to diſcouer the lamentable ſpirit, whereunto they ſeeme to be giuen ouer at this preſent, then by their paſsionate proceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this Reuerend religious man, whoſe merits towards them, and theirs, and vs all are not vnknowen.</hi> He might haue added, <hi>nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requited</hi> in all ſuch ſort as honeſt prieſts may: who are alwayes ready to diſcharge themſelues in all gratefull manner towards him, or any other, who ſhall deſerue it, which doubtles he doth not, who for leſſe then a meſſe of pottage, looketh for more then a large inheritance, and vnder colour of doing well for ſome, doth miſchiefe to all, and layeth a plot only for his owne preferment: as hath been ſhewed by the attempts which haue been made by him, and his officers in the Colledges erected by his meanes, where prieſts and others haue been induced to ſubſcribe to forreine titles, yea and to come in perſon againſt their owne countrey: for which in common ſenſe he looked for a reward at their hands, in whoſe behalf he had thus ſeduced thoſe, who were vnder his charge: which maketh me marueile more at the boldnes of this fellow in his applying of Scriptures againſt the prieſts in the behalfe of <hi>Fa. Parſons,</hi> eſpecially at his blaſphemie, where he ſayth that <hi>F. Parſons</hi> (a moſt wicked, and ſinfull wretch, and in whom it is well knowen there is ouer much poſſibility to deſerue a farre worſe death, then ſtoning) <hi>may ſay with Chriſt himſelfe, and to his imitation,</hi> multa bona ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra oſtendi vobis, propter quod eorum opus me lapidatis? <hi>They haue returned me hatred for my loue toward them: they haue hated me with vniust hatred, they haue payed me euill for good, I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them many benefits, for which now they goe about to ſtone me.</hi> And when poore fooles doe ſee ſuch a <hi>conglomeration</hi> (to vſe his owne word) of Scriptures, they neuer reflect, how the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill himſelfe, and other <hi>to his, imitation</hi> doth cite Scripures, and ſet a better ſhew of matters, then theſe men yet haue done, who neuer came to the point of this controuerſie, but beare off ſtill. And when they ſay any thing concerning it, they fetch it ſo farre off, as a thing done in this moneth, muſt ſtay to be thought vpon, by occaſions offered many moneths after, as is ſhewed in the eighth and ninth Chapters which this author
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:5209:172"/> here quoteth in the margent for his readers great comfort, and edification: But he will paſſe to the particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt particulars are, that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> is called <hi>Parſons,</hi> alias <hi>Cowbucke.</hi> And this is taken in very euil part, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diuers in England are called <hi>ſo</hi> alias <hi>ſo.</hi> And this being ſo ordinary a matter in England, many do doubt that this author knoweth ſome cauſe, why he ſhould winch at it, as hee doeth. And whereas he ſaith, that no one of the kinred were euer ſo called: it is certaine that a brother of his, who liued in a houſe with M. <hi>Brinkly</hi> here mentioned <hi>fol. 183.</hi> was called <hi>Cubbucke.</hi> And whereas it hath been ſaid, that by occaſion of his dealing, in ſome matters the capitall lawes were made in England, his letters are ſhewed of the 24 of Ianuary to the Earle of <hi>Anguiſe,</hi> which doe teſtifie how he buſied himſelfe in State matters, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his firſt comming into England, although he would cloake his dealing with Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond imputation (as hee calleth it) that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> came away, is euident, neither is it to be excuſed by his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall care of the cauſe: for as the prieſts ſay, and M. Do. <hi>Ely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it in his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie,</hi> pag. 211. the two el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Seminaries did ſend into England more prieſts, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in them greater numbers of ſchollers at one time (as hee thinketh) then theſe new Seminaries with the old now decayed will furniſh to ſend into England in diuers yeeres. And for the number of ſtudents, prieſts, and proper youthes, there were moe for many yeeres together (ſo long as D. <hi>Allen</hi> gouerned) in theſe Seminaries at one time, then are now, or hereafter like to be in all the Seminaries, put them all together. <hi>I haue ſeene</hi> (ſayth Do. <hi>Ely</hi>) <hi>fiftie prieſts in one yeere ſent out of Rhemes, and yet fiftie other prieſts remaine in the Colledge st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll. Haue all the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo many in them now? no, no.</hi> And the Catholicks in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land haue had more increaſe by the Seminary prieſts, then by the Ieſuits, whatſoeuer this author affirmeth, fol. 185. For the Ieſuits taught the Scottiſh nation how to keepe their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences locked vp, and to goe without any conſcience to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Churches, as good proofe will be made. But after all Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> good deeds, for which (for ſo much as they may be called good) he hath and ſhall haue many thankes, this author
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:5209:172"/> enlargeth himſelfe very farre, when he ſayth, that without theſe good deeds it is like, that the prieſts had not now bene prieſts, neither without nor within England. And why ſo? <hi>you ſhall find that many of them were ſent in by him.</hi> This is true, and more then a good many haue beene ſent by him. And if we would wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with him, wee might ſay, that he ſent ſome to diſgrace the whole body of Secular prieſts, or els they had neuer ben made prieſts by him, he being told before ſuch particulars of them, as if hee had had any care of the Church, hee would not haue made them prieſts. But put the caſe, that the Seminarie of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> had not decayed by the erection of the new Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, why might not theſe, and many more then now are, be prieſts, both within and without England? Can this author ſay ſo much of all the new Seminaries together with the olde alſo, as M. Doct. <hi>Ely</hi> hath teſtified for that of <hi>Rhemes</hi> onely? But if this author can deceiue his reader, it is as much as he deſireth, which hee thinketh will take beſt effect, if hee could perſwade him, that the Seminaries haue more flouriſhed ſince F. <hi>Parſons</hi> going out of England, then before: although nothing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prieſts haue come into England, as did before, according to the rate of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third accuſation againſt</hi> F. Parſons <hi>is</hi> (ſayth this authour) <hi>that after his going out of England, hee neuer ceaſed to exaſperate the chiefe magiſtrates with libels and factious letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This accuſation dependeth in the proofe vpon the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſuch, as to whome his letters haue beene ſhewed: and by his <hi>Greenecoat,</hi> and ſuch like pamphlets, but eſpecially <hi>his booke of Titles,</hi> wherein he diſcouereth his intention for the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the crowne of England to the Spaniard, which alſo his trecherous attempts in Spaine among the ſtudents, haue made more manifeſt, by hauing them to ſubſcribe to that title, and by thruſting them into the inuaders ſhips: and all which heere is ſaidin commendation of that booke, is and will be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by thoſe, who haue vndertaken to anſwere it. And thus alſo is ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuen to the fourth matter, againſt which this author taketh exception, as againſt a manifeſt calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for his letters haue ben intercepted and ſhewed to diuers, although they are not put in print. And in a late booke, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:5209:173"/> 
                  <hi>A Manifeſtation of ſpirits,</hi> there is ſome feare ſhewed, that his letter to the Earle of <hi>Anguiſe</hi> is intercepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fift calumniation</hi> (hee ſayth) <hi>might be diuided into many parts:</hi> But to quit the accuſers hee telleth his readers, that the Temporall magiſtrate doeth not preſſe the prieſts, but fauour them rather: which of late is very true, ſince they haue knowen the difference betweene prieſts and Statiſts, although the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour be not ſo great, as it might be and may be, when her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie may be throughly informed of the prieſts their trueth and loyaltie to her perſon, crowne, eſtate, and dignity, yet haue not the prieſts vſed this little fauor, which they haue had, to the afflicting any of their Catholicke brethren in durance, as here it is moſt maliciouſly ſuggeſted, but to the comfort of many.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the ſixt accuſation againſt F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt goe looke in the eight Chapter, whither wee alſo doe referre the Reader for anſwere, to what is there brought by this author.</p>
               <p>Now followeth a defence of Father <hi>Parſons</hi> againſt what is related in the <hi>Latine</hi> booke of the vſage of the two prieſts that went to Rome. And this fellow ſayth all out of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall informations. As firſt that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> did interteine the two prieſts <hi>kindly</hi> in his owne chamber. They confeſſe they were interteined after a long difficultie. But what <hi>authenticall proofe</hi> is there, that he did it <hi>kindly,</hi> or that it was done without difficultie? He told them, that they might not talke with any of the ſchollers, and no one of the ſchollers can ſay, that euer they did talke with any of them, but one, whom M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> was very deſirous to ſee: and he was brought to M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> by the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> of the Colledge, who ſtood by, and heard al which paſſed; M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> did know, that there was one in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whoſe mother is his couſen germane, and neuer coueted to talke with him. The quarrell which was againſt theſe two prieſts, was for talking with ſuch as were appointed by <hi>Fa. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to attend them in the hoſpitall, whereof he, who is here ſaid to be the <hi>vertuous prieſt,</hi> was a Ieſuit in a Secular prieſts coat, and ſhortly after wore a Ieſuits coate, and died among them. And the occaſion of this talke was miniſtred by this <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous priest,</hi> and it was not of this preſent controuerſie, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:5209:173"/> M. <hi>Edward Tempest,</hi> concerning whom it was ſaid, that he was hardly dealt withall, in regard that ſuch as vſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prieſts at their firſt arriuall in England, were perſwaded not to intertaine him; And that ſome of his neereſt friends were told, that in conſcience they could not relieue him. An other was a ieaſt, which had chanced about 20. yeeres ſince in the Colledge of Rome: which becauſe it concerned one, who was choſen in England for an aſſiſtant, the matter was taken hainouſly, yet was the occaſion hereof alſo miniſtred by tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>vertuous priest,</hi> and the matter it ſelfe was but a mery tale. And this is al, which was alledged by <hi>F. Owen</hi> the Ieſuit in the name of <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> againſt the two prieſts: yet doeth this author moſt ſhameleſly relate, that the two prieſts had talked that, which might raiſe or renew ſedition among the ſchollers. But this, and all which foloweth, is doubtleſſe brought in this place, that this author might ſhew, how he could gall his reader with his owne tale, as an <hi>authenticall teſtimony,</hi> for other teſtimony there is not. That alſo which is here gaineſaid of Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> letter, was ſaid vpon the relation of thoſe who ſaw it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue not the copy to ſhew. And for ſo much as concerneth the principall point of <hi>F. Bellarmines</hi> letter, to wit, the impriſoning of the two prieſts, it is confeſſed in his <hi>Apologie Cap. 4. fol. 120.</hi> out of the ſame letter. The prieſts there being impriſoned in the Colledge, is reputed agreat benefit vnto them. They thought it not ſo, but onely in this reſpect, that they thought their liues were more in ſafety in the Colledge, then in a common priſon: But in reſpect of the common cauſe without doubt it had bene a great preiudice, had they had any hope of iuſtice. But their hope was ſmall, when they ſaw that they were to be infamouſly caried away to priſon, before they could get audience. But it troubleth this author much that <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> ſhould be termed <hi>a Iaylor:</hi> eſpecially there being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had the keyes of their chambers to bring them meat, and all other neceſſaries: but he telleth not who had the keyes all the reſt of the day. If <hi>F. Parſons</hi> had not bene ſeene to weare them at his girdle, this matter might haue bene ſomewhat clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier caried: but it was too open to be excuſed.</p>
               <p>Next followeth a defence of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> for his ſhewing of M.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:5209:174"/> 
                  <hi>Charnocks</hi> handkerchiefs, and night coyfes, which (this author ſaith) <hi>were ſo wrought with ſilke, and gold lace, is they might ſeeme to ſerue for any Secular prince in the world, and the ſocks for his feete were of ſo fine Holland, as the Commiſſary ſaid he was well aſſured, that his Holines neuer woare ſuch for his ſhirts.</hi> You muſt imagine, that this relation is very <hi>authenticall,</hi> although M. <hi>Charnock</hi> had neither handkerchiefe, nor night coife, that any Ieſuite in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would vouchſafe to weare, they were ſo meane: I haue ſeene the night coife, and it is wrought in deed with ſilke. For it hath a border of blacke ſilke about it 3. fingers broad: and all the reſt of the cap is plaine Holland, it hath ſome <hi>6.</hi> pennie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of gold, and ſiluer edging, and as many as haue ſeene the cappe wonder at the impudencie of this Author: who perchance did thinke the cappe would not haue bene kept. The conceit which is made of his handkerchiefes is much more ridiculous. And by the tale of his ſockes this Author bringeth into my minde a tale of a preacher, who tolde his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that Chriſt fed fiue hundred with ſuch a ſmall quantity, and being told ſoftly by the Clarke, that they were fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, he bad him hold his peace like a foole, and told him, that if he could perſwade the people, that they were fiue hundred, he had done a good dayes worke. I vnderſtand that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary ſayd, how that <hi>his Holines did not weare ſo fine cloth in his bands.</hi> But this author thought this was too much to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore he ſet it downe, <hi>the Popes ſhirts. Whereupon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conferring with M.</hi> Charnocke <hi>himſelfe</hi> (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> and <hi>M. Biſhop,</hi> vpon the 8. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> when they were to haue the firſt fauour to ſpeake together, and to walke at libertie in the College at certaine times) <hi>when anſwere was made, that prieſts now a dayes for diſsimulation are forced to vſe ſuch things in England: he replied that at the leaſtwiſe it was not needefull to bring ſuch ſtrange delicacies to Rome, and that albeit in ſome externall apparell, diſsimulation might be tolerable in Engliſh Prieſts at home in reſpect of the times, yet in ſuch thinge whereof their vſe was onely in ſecret, as night-coifes, and ſockes, and the like, he ſaw no neede of exceſſe, or diſsimulation. And this was all that paſſed in this matter,</hi> vpon the faith of ſuch an honeſt man, as writ this <hi>Apologie.</hi> But now ſir, one tale is tolde, the other is not told:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:5209:174"/> which is that M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> anſwere was to this effect, <hi>that Prieſts traueiling vp &amp; down</hi> in England, were to vſe ſuch things as were fit for ſuch perſons, as they bare in their trauaile, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they lay not in Catholike houſes, where they were knowen, but in common Innes, where neither night-coifes, not ſocks were vſed in ſecret. And for his bringing thoſe things to Rome, his anſwere was, that hee had neceſſary vſe of them at his comming out of England, &amp; making account to returne againe, he had little reaſon to throwe thoſe things away, after that they had the firſt time ſerued him. And if it had pleaſed them at Rome to haue left his Truncke vnſearched, the cap had neuer ben ſeene in Rome. And M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> being requeſted to ſay what he knew of <hi>this ſtrange delicacie,</hi> affirmed that he had neuer ſeene it before. But if M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> had either worne it by the way, as he trauailed in England to the ſea coaſt, or at ſea, where he was not knowen, nor willing to be knowen for ſuch as hee was, what an abſurd exception was this, that he did bring ſuch things to Rome, as though he ought to haue caſt them away? But this fellow careth not what halfe tales he telleth, to make his Reader beleeue any thing, which might any way tend to the diſcredite of a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The long tale which this author telleth of <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Oxford</hi> I will omit: becauſe it runneth into many particulars, of which I haue no knowledge. But the trueth is, he was expelled, and the bels were rong at <hi>Magdalene</hi> College for his expulſion. And this authour his charging the fellowes with the breach of oath, when they made knowen his expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is very ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of his expulſion I omit to ſet them downe in this place, as they are deliuered vnto vs: onely this I note, that it was not <hi>for religion,</hi> howſoeuer he might haue an inclination thereunto, and might be the worſe liked of therefore by ſome: for of this imputation or <hi>ſlander</hi> (as he called it) he offered to a Gentleman of the Temple to cleare himſelfe by oth. But when the fellowes proceeded to his expulſion, and no man ſtood for him, hee requeſted that he might reſigne: to which the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes yeelded. Then did he write in this manner: <hi>Ego Robertus Parſonus ſocius Collegij de Baliolo, reſigno omne meum ius, titulum,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:5209:175"/> &amp; claimeum, quem habeo vel habere potere, ſocietatis mea in dicto Collegio, quod quidem facio ſponte, &amp; coactus die decimo tertio men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Februarij, Anno Domini 1573. I Robert Parſons, fellow of the Colledge of Balioll, reſigne all my right, title, and claime which I haue, or may haue, of my fellowſhip in the ſame College: which I doe of mine owne accord and compelled thereto the 13. of February, in the yeere of our Lord, 1573.</hi> This being done, he made requeſt that this might be kept ſecret for a time, and that he might keepe his chambers and ſcholers as a fellow of the houſe, which was alſo granted vnto him: and thereupon was this decree written as followeth. <hi>Eodem tempore decretum est vnanimi conſenſu Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri &amp; reliquorum ſociorum, vt Magister Robertus Parſonus nuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimè ſocius retineat ſibi ſua cubicula, &amp; ſcholares quouſque volucrit, &amp; communia ſua de Collegio habeat vſque ad feſtum Paſchatis imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatè ſequentis:</hi> That is, <hi>It is dereed at the ſame time by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent of the Maſter, and the rest of the fellowes that</hi> M. Robert Parſons <hi>late fellow, doe retaine his chambers and ſchollers, as long as he will, and haue his commons of the College, vniill the feaſt of</hi> Eaſter <hi>next following.</hi> But <hi>F. Par.</hi> perceining ſhortly after that his knell had bene rung at <hi>Magdalene</hi> College, and how he was mocked by ſome in the houſe, he left the College and went to London, where he conferred with a Gentleman of the middle Temple about his trauaile to ſtudie phiſicke, to whom hee offered to take his oath, that he was <hi>ſlandered with the name of a Papiſt,</hi> and that hee neither was a Papiſt, nor euer meant to be one. But withall this is to be noted that this authour appealing fol. 193. to the Regiſters of <hi>Balioll</hi> colledge: the Regiſters haue bene ſought, and there is ſome little difference in the words of the Reſignation: for where we haue cited it <hi>ſponte &amp; coactus,</hi> now there is a daſh through <hi>&amp;,</hi> and this word <hi>non,</hi> writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer head, a manifeſt ſigne of ſome falſe dealing. For it is not likely that <hi>&amp;</hi> in that place would haue bin written for <hi>non:</hi> it maketh a cleane contrary ſenſe. Neither is the obiection well ſolued fol. 197. which brought <hi>F. Parſons</hi> in ſuſpition of baſtardie: for there are diuers, who confirme as much as the prieſts ſaid: that is, <hi>that it was the common opinion through out the whole Countrey.</hi> His quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with diuers of his order, and others, will be iuſtified: and the letter of M. <hi>Benſtead</hi> will alſo be prooued to be falſified. But
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:5209:175"/> the patch which is clapped vpon the 201. leaſe, argueth how forward theſe fellowes are to diſcredite the prieſts with moſt falſe and ſcandalous imputations, when they themſelues are aſhamed thereof. That which concerneth M. D. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> is to be anſwered by himſelfe: who no doubt knoweth in what caſes doubtfull anſweres and equiuocations are to be made to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious queſtions: neither is it to be thought, that he diſallowed thereof, but onely of the liberty which is in the Ieſuites, and their adherents, in all their dealings with other men, through which all confidence is taken away among men, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſenſes theſe fellowes will alleage, that they had in their ſpeeches and actions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the 13. Chapter this Authour vſeth gentle perſwaſions to his diſcontented brethren, and propoſeth certaine conſiderations, and a better way for reunion againe, as he ſuppoſeth. In the firſt conſideration occurreth nothing worthy noting, his rayling ſpeeches excepted, &amp; hudling vp of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures one vpon another, againſt the diſobedient to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, which concerneth the prieſts nothing at all, who neuer diſobeyed their knowen Superiours, but alwayes ſubmitted themſelues vnto them, as it is manifeſtly prooued in all their bookes, and more at large in M. <hi>Collingtons</hi> booke, and in M. D. <hi>Ely</hi> his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie.</hi> He maketh a recapitulation of ſome matters in the ſame falſe vaine, in which he writ this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,</hi> as is ſufficiently diſcouered in this anſwere to the places
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:5209:176"/> quoted by him: and in the ſame kind is his ſecond conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imputing the iuſt defence of the prieſts from the Ieſuits impoſture of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and other grieuous ſinnes to <hi>emulation, hatred, pride, reuenge, libertie,</hi> and other his owne, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes humours.</p>
               <p>In the third conſideration he doeth explicate himſelfe, how the prieſts dealt with the Counſell, and his firſt tale ſoundeth ſo ſhamefully falſe, as it were ynough to conuince an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man, that this author had no honeſtie, nor care of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. And doubtleſſe had there not bene a great dearth of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, this place ſhould haue had a patch vpon it, as was put vpon that malitious, and wicked gloſe againſt the ſame man, and his fellowes <hi>fol. 201.</hi> Note I pray you, the impudencie of this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as before you haue heard</hi> (and in the margent he quoteth the 10. and 12. Chapters) <hi>as ſoone as euer they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that their two meſſengers were reſtrained in Rome, and not like to preuaile, then</hi> D. Bagſhaw <hi>was ſent for from</hi> Wisbich <hi>to London, to treat with the Counſell, &amp;c.</hi> Could this man perſwade himſelfe, that euery mans wit was a woolgathering, when this doctour was ſent for from <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and that no man would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how that this ſending for him was about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> or not long after, and that the two meſſengers were not reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Rome,</hi> vntill the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> after? This fellow his affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that M. <hi>Bluet</hi> had conference with the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Counſell, and Queene her ſelfe, for the printing and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>theſe Libels</hi> (as he termeth them) ſaid to bee printed at <hi>Roane,</hi> is moſt falſe. For theſe bookes were not printed by any ſuch meanes, but at the charge of the prieſts, and in moſt ſecret maner. And their charge was double in regard of the Printers danger; And this probable reaſon might ſatisfie an indifferent man, that there want not as good Printers in England, as are in <hi>Roane,</hi> and yet the bookes are full of faults. And if the bookes had bene printed by any ſuch licenſe, they would haue had more skilfull Printers, and not haue had ſo many, and ſo groſſe eſcapes, euident arguments of the Printers inſufficiencie. This authors relation alſo, that <hi>vpon M.</hi> Bluets <hi>conference with the Biſhop, &amp;c. there was a generall ſearch for taking of Catholicks, ſuch as neuer lightly before hath bene heard of,</hi> is to be conuinced
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:5209:176"/> of great impudencie, in that the moſt buſie Agents of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and the Archprieſt, in the furthering of their ſeditious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, were neuer called vpon or ſearched: whereas contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the houſes where the prieſts friends remained, were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſearched, which was a greater argument, that the Ieſuits, and their faction cauſed the ſearch, then M <hi>Bluet</hi> or any of his fellowes. And this is euident by recounting the chiefe of the faction of the Ieſuits, &amp; Archprieſt, who dwelled then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and were ſo farre from the danger of being ſearched or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as they were not broken of their ſleepe, or any way mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, vnleſſe it were by the Officers their reuell in other mens houſes. The ſtory alſo of the <hi>diſcouery of their</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>print and bookes, but all reſtored againe with celeritie, and fauour,</hi> is both falſe, and exceeding fooliſhly heere inſerted. Falſe in that the prieſts neuer had any Print, but to their double, yea treble charge, and by great friendſhip of a gentleman got their books printed, they themſelues neither know where, nor by whom, but as it ſhould ſeeme by ſome meane, and needy Printer, who in conſideration of being well payd, aduentured to print them. Neither was any of their books at that time in the preſſe, or in any Printers hands, nor euer needed any reſtoring, either with celeritie, or fauour. I vnderſtand, that about the ſame time the Ieſuits had a preſſe taken, and many bookes, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored againe vnto them, but this was not in <hi>London,</hi> nor by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ſearch. But by this may be ſeene the falſhood of this fellow. Now it remaineth, that his folly alſo be ſhewed This ſearch (he ſaith) was an effect of M <hi>Bluets</hi> conference with the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the Counſell and Queene her ſelfe, as the printing was, and publiſhing of their bookes. Is it likely that the printing, and publiſhing of theſe bookes could be a cleare effect of M. <hi>Bluets</hi> conference with theſe, and that the Print was ſubiect to be taken, and the books alſo? Could neither the <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> nor the Counſel, no not the Queene herſelfe protect the Print and the books, not onely from being diſcouered, but from being taken away alſo, that they ſhould need to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe? this ſearch being alſo a cleare effect of the ſame conference with the Biſhop, Counſell, and Queene herſelfe. How doeth he forget himſelfe? how groſſely doeth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:5209:177"/> his matters together? He muſt alſo tell his Reader, that the <hi>Bb.</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had M. <hi>Bluet</hi> to his houſe at <hi>Fulham</hi> for fuller conference, making him good cheare, as though the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> his table were not ordinarily to entertaine a greater man then M. <hi>Bluet,</hi> or that M. <hi>Bluet</hi> were of their diſpoſition, for whom muſt alwayes be an extraordinary prouiſion, for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their fatherhoods. Maſter Bluet <hi>was alſo ſuffered to goe where hee would without a Keeper.</hi> And what harme was this? I haue not heard of any ſummes of money which the <hi>Bb</hi> ſhould giue vnto him for any purpoſe, as this author ſuggeſteth. But if it had beene ſo, yet whatſoeuer this author would haue his reader imagine, he cannot prooue that M. <hi>Bluet</hi> hath employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe in any euill office. This moſt wicked impoſtor doth furthermore labour, to haue his reader to make no better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of M. <hi>Bluet</hi> and his fellowes, then of <hi>Tirrell</hi> or <hi>Bell,</hi> a couple of knowen enemies: yea a farre worſe, <hi>ſeeing</hi> (ſayth this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor) <hi>that neither</hi> Anthony Tirrell, <hi>nor</hi> Thomas Bell, <hi>nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (he meanes perchance ſome of his fellow Apoſtataes Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that haue precipitated themſelues in this time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>did euer engage themſelues further with the Councell, then theſe men ſeeme to haue done.</hi> And how doeth this companion prooue this? Forſooth, by a letter of M. <hi>Bluets</hi> (as he ſayth) of the firſt of <hi>Iuly</hi> vnto M. <hi>Muſh,</hi> to which letter there is this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>Yours Thomas Bluet:</hi> and yet the letter ſpeaketh thus of M. <hi>Bluet,</hi> as if he were not the Inditer thereof. <hi>I haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by opening the cauſe vnto their honours, and to Ceſar, that foure principall men ſhalbe baniſhed after a ſort to follow the Appeale, D.</hi> Bagſhaw, Bluet, Champney, <hi>&amp;</hi> Barnley: would M. <hi>Bluet</hi> haue written in this ſort to any man, and haue ſet his name to the letter, as from himſelfe? But marke, I pray you, what followeth: <hi>all priſoners, they ſhall be here with me on Wedneſday next.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hee followeth on in the ſame kinde, ſpeaking of the ſame men. <hi>A moneth they ſhall haue within the Realme of libertie, to ride abroad for money among their friends, and then chuſe their port to be gone, with ſome countenance, &amp;c.</hi> And after all this clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe, as if hee writ not the letter, but ſome other, his name is put to it, as is ſaid, <hi>Yours Thomas Bluet.</hi> Many wayes are ſought by this companion to bring Maſter <hi>Bluet</hi> and the other
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:5209:177"/> prieſts, into an euill opinion with all Catholikes, and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations are made of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents in this letter. But among all the reſt, I wonder how the Ieſuits come to be talked of: <hi>I haue layd the fault</hi> (ſayth this letter) <hi>where it ought to be, and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the Secular prieſts are innocent for the moſt part, &amp;c.</hi> This companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his commentary, expoundeth theſe words, <hi>where it ought to be,</hi> in this manner, <hi>that is to ſay, vpon the Ieſuits.</hi> And why ſo? what haue the Ieſuits at any time done, that no ſooner can any mention be made of <hi>a fault,</hi> but euery ſilly fellowe can interprete, what is meant thereby, to wit, <hi>ſome fact of a Ieſuite?</hi> haue they ſo badly behaued themſelues in all mens opinion, yea in their owne, as no fault can be, but a Ieſuit muſt be at one end? But this companion would haue his reader haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that this their fault might be the defence of Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as though Ma. <hi>Bluet</hi> (whoſe letter this is ſaid to be) did eſteeme that a fault. Is he not full fraught with moſt wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that would driue ſuch a conceit into his readers head, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a venerable prieſt, and one who hath ſuffered in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Catholicke faith, before any Ieſuite dared to come neere vnto England, for all thoſe proud vaunts that they were the men ſpecially raiſed by God, to ouerthrow <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers? What M. <hi>Watſon</hi> did in Scotland, he is to anſwere it himſelfe: but doubtleſſe he was not employed thither in any ſuch affaires, as this author affirmeth, by any of the prieſts He hath ſpent time there (as other prieſts haue) to repreſſe that wicked doctrine of the Ieſuits, that a man might locke vp his conſcience, after that he had heard maſſe, and then goe to the proteſtants Churches. Neither doe wee knowe what <hi>meaning</hi> any of thoſe had to deale with the French king in any State matters whome this author ſo taxeth. Hee who is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>meanings,</hi> wil perchance in his larger <hi>Apologie</hi> tell vs more newes thereof. The ſtories of <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Simon,</hi> and others, who went to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and others here named, can haue no place here, vnleſſe this companion doe compare his holineſſe vnto <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as hee compareth the prieſts to <hi>Aleimus</hi> and <hi>Simon.</hi> For all the world is a witneſſe for the Prieſts, that they went to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. to ſeeke for iuſtice, and that they ſought not to any other for iuſtice in the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:5209:178"/> controuerſie betweene the Ieſuites and them: although they ſought their princes fauour, which they might lawfully doe, and deſire to enioy it, as the Catholiques in the primitiue Church haue ſometime done: and doe pray vnto God duely for her proſperous raigne: and that God will incline her heart to haue compaſſion vpon ſuch her moſt loyall and faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as haue heretofore moſt vniuſtly ben condemned for the euill practiſes of a few buſie fellowes.</p>
               <p>The fourth conſideration co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of twelue ſpecial points, which I feare will lie heauy vpon their ſoules, who are guilty of theſe ſtirres. The prieſts make no doubt of the iuſtice of their cauſe. And while this matter doth hang in queſtion, this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> well conſidered, and aduiſedly read, doth it ſelfe very much preiudice their cauſe, in whoſe defence it pretendeth to be written: If it ſhall be hereafter iudged that the prieſts were <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> becauſe they did not accept of the new authority, before they ſaw a <hi>Breue</hi> from his Holines, without doubt they haue much to anſwere for. But if contrariwiſe it ſhalbe iudged, that they were not <hi>ſchiſmatikes,</hi> then muſt the Ieſuits and their adherents be the men, who haue been the cauſe of all the euill which hath come vpon this ſlander raiſed by them againſt the prieſts: And vpon this alſo dependeth the fift conſideration: for if it be proued, that the Ieſuites and their adherents did iniurie the prieſts in ſo high a degree, and a publique infamie of <hi>ſchiſme &amp;c.</hi> then will it not auaile them to ſay, that the prieſts ſhould haue conſidered, that it was a time of perſecution, and that they ſhuld haue ſuffred this infamie, rather then haue ſtirred in their own defence. If this doctrine of his might paſſe currant in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral warres, there would indeed quickly be an end therof: for by this rate euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is wickedly inclined, might murther his fellow without any contradiction, for feare of endangering the campe, if the vniuſtly aſſaulted ſhould ſeeke to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This companion ſhould haue remembred that the prieſts ſent to his Holineſſe, to whom it belonged to determine this controuerſie, and that they haue not ſtirred in any thing, more then in procuring that the quarrell might come to his hearing: For which purpoſe they iudged it moſt neceſſary, to make the world acquainted therewith, hauing once before bene fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:5209:178"/> thereof, by reaſon of their ouer great confidence in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their cauſe onely.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt conſideration this authour taketh his pleaſure in diſcrediting the prieſts, who would not conſent, that the Ieſuits, the Archprieſt, with the rabblement of their moſt wicked, and ſeditious adherents, ſhall eſteeme of them, as of <hi>ſchiſmatikes, ſoothſayers, Idolaters, Ethnickes, and Publicanes:</hi> And he would perſwade his Reader, that they are not onely <hi>few in number,</hi> but <hi>greene in credit, without ſcruple of conſcience what they vtter; and therefore not to be truſted in matters which concerne the liues, ſtates, and honors of men, who ſhall fall out with them:</hi> yea his Reader muſt vnderſtand, that thoſe who haue yeelded to the enemie in one or two ſteps, could neuer go backe againe, but muſt yeeld in greater matters, and diſcouer all they knowe againſt their brethren, if not more. He ſpeaketh as clerklike, as if he had ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the greateſt ſecrets of his factious adherents, which will one day perchance come foorth, and the parties named who haue done aſmuch, as he mentioneth. But as for the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant prieſts, he cannot charge them iuſtly, that they haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any ſuch thing. If any prieſt hath yeelded any further, then to thinke himſelfe highly fauoured, that there hath beene notice taken of his faith, and loyalty towards his Prince and countrey; let the prieſt be made knowen, and he ſhal be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of accordingly by the prieſts: and if no man haue yeelded in any other matter, then is the <hi>Apologie</hi>-maker a notorious wicked impoſter.</p>
               <p>The laſt conſideration is of the neceſſitie of vnion (which is handled with exhortations vnto it: and diſſwaſions from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion) and of the facilitie of making it againe among vs, and to ſhew, that there is a great facilitie, he will aske his <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented brethren that ſhew themſelues ſo mightily inraged, what is there which they would haue in this matter? who vexeth, or vrgeth them ſo, as they may not liue quietly if they would?</hi> A couple of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable queſtions, and therefore this anſwere is made vnto them. Firſt they would haue that, which the Ieſuits, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, and all their ſeditious adherents are bound vnder paine of eternall damnation to perfourme: that is, that theſe doe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:5209:179"/> make reſtitution vnto the prieſts, for thoſe moſt wicked ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Schiſme, ſedition, rebellion &amp;c.</hi> which are contained in Father <hi>Liſter</hi> the Ieſuites booke, and their owne moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious ſtomackes, without any iuſt cauſe giuen vnto them by the prieſts. Secondly they haue prooued, that the Ieſuites and Archprieſt (with all the ſeditious followers) doe vexe them ſo much, as in them lieth, and doe vrge them ſo, as they cannot <hi>liue quietly</hi> by them: but in euery corner there is ſome of this ſedition to warne all good Catholikes to flie them, not to giue them any entertainement, or reliefe. And all this is to driue them either to periſh, or to belie their owne ſoules, with the great diſhonour both of God, and his Church. And as for the Archprieſts good nature, here ſpecified, it is very ridiculous. He recalled his Cenſures, when the prieſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelues vpon the ſight of his Holineſſe <hi>Breue,</hi> which cenſures he had vſed againſt three prieſts, becauſe they had appealed from him to the pope (as it is ſet downe in the booke to the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi>) And I doubt not but that the Archprieſt would be as glad now, that all were well accorded, as he was at the firſt attonement, and be as ready perchance to breake out againe, as then hee was: as it is prooued in the bookes to his Holineſſe, and to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> neither is there any man, that is in his wittes, but will thinke that the Ieſuits and Archprieſt would haue peace: that is, power to vſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſts at their pleaſure, and that the prieſts ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all manner of indignities both in fame, and otherwiſe, and not to ſtirre for anie thing, which may be done againſt them: leaſt the Ieſuites peace be broken, which they loue ſo deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cloake it with extraordinary pietie in this place <hi>fol.</hi> 221: where they are ſayd to haue ſtoode with the Archprieſt and the reſt in defence of his Holines ordination, as though the prieſts had euer reſiſted his Holines ordination, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeelded themſelues preſently at the ſight of the <hi>Breue,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which, there was no Popes ordination. And to this the Ieſuites their ſtanding in defence of his Holineſſe ordination, are ioyned moſt abſurd poſitions of their deſire not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the prieſts affaires: whereas it hath beene ſhewed, that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:5209:179"/> they haue been the chiefe of this ſedition againſt the prieſts. And their interpretation, that their dealing proceedes of loue, is to men of vnderſtanding an argument of a factious diſpoſition, and deſiring of gouerning all ſortes of people, whoſoeuer muſt play the Apes part, to take away the enuie for their miſdeedes from them. <hi>They intend not</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>to preiudice them in any preferment for the time preſent, or to come.</hi> Hee were worſe then madde, that would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe with our Ieſuites intentions, which varie as often as their tongues moue, and turne their intentions to ſerue beſt their owne turnes. Let the Ieſuites their hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all our nation beyond the Seas from al promotion, ſpeake for their intentions: ſince that no place, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there can be had, without degrees in ſchooles, which they haue induced his Holineſſe to debarre all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh nation, vnder this other intention, that young men muſt not take the degrees, when they depart from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries.</p>
               <p>And that their intention may be the more euident, that they will hinder euery mans preferrement, they haue put into the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> a barre not onely for the proceeding in Diuinitie, the knowledge whereof they haue now alſo cleane taken out of the Colledge at <hi>Doway:</hi> but in either of the Lawes alſo Ciuill, or Canon: which are not taught in any of our Seminaries. Yet muſt all their intentions bee moſt excellent, and muſt not be thought to preiudice any for the time preſent, or to come. As for the time to come, were it in their hands to preiudice any man, all their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, and oathes would carie little credite but with ſuch as know them not. In which as in all other their dealings, eſpecially in this action the prieſts doe moſt willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them their falſhood, and doe pray for them, that God will giue them and their adherents his grace to amende, what they cannot chuſe but ſee is amiſſe in themſelues. To which they may make a good ſteppe, if they will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne conſciences, and conſider of what great ſcandals, and harmes in Gods Church they haue beene
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:5209:180"/> a very faulty occaſion, by that moſt wicked imputation of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> to moſt Catholicke prieſtes, and their obdurate ſtanding in that ſinfull opinion, without admitting any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall triall of the cauſe in queſtion, which the prieſts did offer in moſt humble wiſe, before they tooke the courſe that now they take, and was onely left vnto them, to cleare themſelues of ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a ſlander.</p>

               <head>¶ A REPLY TO THE <hi>Appendix</hi> of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> by J. B.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE author of the <hi>Apologie</hi> hauing ſeene other two bookes beſide thoſe, againſt which he writ his <hi>Apologie,</hi> maketh an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere (ſuch as it is) vnto them, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere he calleth, <hi>An</hi> Appendix <hi>to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie by the Prieſts that remaine in due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their lawfull Superior.</hi> As though an Appeale made from a ſuperior vpon iuſt cauſes, and a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proſecution thereof could not ſtand with <hi>due obedience.</hi> But ſomewhat muſt be ſaid, and if it haue no pith in it, as euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader will ſoone diſcouer that want in this <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> it muſt be ouercharged with bigge words, which the <hi>blinde obedient</hi> muſt imagine would not haue bene vttered without iuſt cauſe, although they ſee none.</p>
               <p>After a long conflict then (as it ſhould ſeeme) in this author, whether hee ſhould take notice of theſe two latter bookes, to which he hath made it knowen (both in this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> and other two ſcurrilous Libels ſet out ſince this <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> came forth) that he cannot make any anſwere, he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured to ſay ſomewhat of them, and that it might not bee made too apparant to the world, how little the poore man had to ſay herein, hee ſtuffeth theſe few leafes with exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe bookes, to which he pretended an anſwere in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> &amp; enlargeth himſelfe ſomewhat by way of a preface, wherein he telleth his reader, how vnwillingly he <hi>put his pen to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:5209:181"/> paper for the defence of our Superiors, and their lawfull doings, and proceedings againſt the intemperate impugnations by tumult, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of a few diſcontented brethren, &amp;c.</hi> And no man can but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, that it was ſore againſt his will, that he had ſuch cauſe as he had to vſe his pen, although he neuer made daintie of his paines and pen, where hee thought he might diſcredit thoſe prieſts, which he could not bring to his lure. And as for the prieſts their doings or proceedings, they haue ſhewed themſelues ready to giue accompt thereof, and to proue both the lawfulneſſe, and the neceſſitie, which was in withſtanding the exorbitant proceedings of ſuch, as hauing neither any Chriſtian wiſdom, nor honeſtie, abuſed our Superiors, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that al the prieſts ſhould be brought into theſe ſtreights, to wit, either to yeeld to the wicked deſignes of others, or to be made infamous all the world ouer. And to this effect was the treatiſe <hi>of ſchiſme</hi> written by the Ieſuits, and ſent abroad not onely in England, but into remote places beyond the ſeas, to perſwade ſuch as would be blinde, that Catholike prieſts, who had liued in a long &amp; moſt dangerous perſecution for defence of the ſea Apoſtolike, were now become <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> and why? becauſe they did not, contrary to the lawes of Gods Church, yeeld their obedience to a creature of the Ieſuits, intruded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as their Superior, without any warrant from the Sea Apoſtolike, which hath commanded that no ſuch ſuperior be accepted, without a ſpeciall warrant, or letters from the ſame Sea, as may be ſeene in that <hi>extrauagant</hi> of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. <hi>Iniunct. de electione,</hi> and was afterward extended by <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3. to ſuch as is our preſent Prelacie. And all the ſcandall which hath growne out of this contention, muſt be anſwered by thoſe who moſt iniuriouſly did driue the prieſts to ſo hard a choice, and if the prieſts haue in the proſecution of their iuſt defence bin aſſiſted by ſuch, as in ſome other reſpect do diſclaime from them, and other their actions, the Ieſuits and their adherents cannot ſo cary it away, with ſaying that they haue <hi>combined themſelues in ſecret with the knowen enemies and aduerſaries of our Catholicke faith.</hi> But they muſt proue, that they haue made an vnlawfull combination, it being euident to the world, that there may be as wicked and vniuſt combinations betweene
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:5209:181"/> men of the ſame religion, as betweene men of diuers. And as it hath bene anſwered before, the prieſts haue iuſtified and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues ſufficiently, by their apparance at <hi>Rome,</hi> from all ſuſpition of euill dealing, or other <hi>combinations,</hi> then which Catholike prieſts might make, and thinke themſelues infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholding to their gouernours, that they are accepted of by them in that degree in which they are. But liſten how faire as falſe a tale he telleth his reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Apologie <hi>therefore</hi> (ſayth this author) <hi>written by vs, was to ſtay ſomewhat this violent courſe (if it might be) by laying open quietly and modeſtly the true grounds of all theſe ſtirres and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, and that not by inuectiues, exaggerations, or inuentions of our owne, as our brethrens books doe, but rather by calme, gentle, and modeſt narration, yea with the greateſt loue and compaſsion of our hearts; alledging alwayes moſt authenticall proofes for that we ſay, ſpeaking alſo the ſame in the beſt and moſt temperate maner we could, and pretermitting many things that might be more odious, if they had beene vttered: and of this wee make Iudges the readers themſelues, that ſhall haue peruſed the ſame, or may hereafter.</hi> It is very ſtrange that indifferent readers cannot ſee any of this in the <hi>Apologie.</hi> If we ſhall truſt to M. Doct. <hi>Ely,</hi> to whom the <hi>Apologie</hi> was ſent by a principall man of the Ieſuits faction to be read, wee ſhall finde by the notes which hee made thereupon, that the <hi>true grounds of all theſe ſtirres,</hi> are not handled in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> but a foule ſtirre made with much impertinent ſtuffe, full of <hi>inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues, exaggerations, and inuentions</hi> of his owne, and his fellow partners in this buſineſſe, and no proofes, but a fewe of their owne letters (a moſt ridiculous manner of proceeding) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the prieſts haue brought their proofes out of the originals of their aduerſaries letters and writings publiſhed by them: and this dealing is alſo diſcouered in the reply to the <hi>Apologie,</hi> how this authour in moſt intemperate manner, and moſt odious termes, ſeeketh the diſgrace of the prieſts for want of other meanes to wrecke himſelfe vpon his aduerſaries, who haue laid too ſure and firme a foundation for him to mooue: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man will be moſt wilfully blind, hee may very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the diſtemperature of this brainſicke companion, where he tearmeth the prieſts, <hi>children of iniquitie, libertines,</hi> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:5209:182"/> them with <hi>ambition, enuy, hatred, contention, malice, prink, malediction, and other like.</hi> His contemptible ſpeeches alſo doe argue little <hi>modeſty</hi> in him: but if he ſhould ſay, that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no <hi>Apologie</hi> at all, his abſurd faction muſt beleeue him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſee him write it, and haue it in their hands: ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious are our newe illuminated Catholikes become, if their guide tell them the tale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſince the writing of the ſayd Apologie, ſome other matters haue fallen out, which doe inuite vs to write againe:</hi> and what are thoſe? forſooth, <hi>our diſcontented brethren haue ſet foorth two other books, and put them alſo in print, intituling the one,</hi> The hope of peace, <hi>by laying open ſuch manifeſt vntrueths, as are diuulged by the Archprieſt, &amp;c. Conſider you how full of</hi> hope <hi>this way may be to</hi> peace. I haue conſidered of it, and I iudge it a moſt effectuall meane for peace to haue falſhood diſcouered, and the doubts or difficulties laide open, which were before ſhuffled vp in ſuch ſort, as the ſtirres brake forth againe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, without giuing ſo much reſpite, as to ſay there was a peace concluded. <hi>The other in Latine, whoſe title beginneth thus,</hi> Relatio compendioſa turbarum, &amp;c. <hi>A compendious rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of troubles, &amp;c.</hi> But now good ſir, what of theſe? wherein doe theſe two bookes trouble you? will you heare his griefe? he hath tolde you ſo many idle tales in his anſwere to the two former bookes, that hee hath none left to beſtow vpon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to theſe, and therefore hee will make quicke worke with them: and to beguile his deuoted the more cunningly, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to tell them a tale of a <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17 of <hi>Auguſt 1601.</hi> which he pretendeth here, that hee had not ſeene it when hee writ this Preface: yet he would not but his reader ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that he was very perfect in it, for he declareth, that there is <hi>a full deciſion of the cauſe in controuerſie, determining all points, that haue beene, or may be in queſtion among vs, or betweene our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and their Superiour, or any bodie elſe.</hi> But as yet could no man euer ſay, that the prieſts were cleered from <hi>ſchiſme</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or condemned as <hi>ſchiſmatickes,</hi> and how then are <hi>all points determined, that haue bene, or may be in question?</hi> or how are any matters determined, which were put vp in the appeale to his Holineſſe? nay the appeale it ſelfe is not admitted, although
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:5209:182"/> the Archprieſt did that, which his Holines could not without griefe relate, as theſe words of the Briefe import: <hi>Quod dolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes referimus:</hi> neither is there any one worde of the Ieſuites, or their diſorders once touched, but in a very fauourable manner: that moſt wicked and ſeditious libell, which they writ againſt the prieſts, is onely ſuppreſſed; and herein doe ſome of them moſt inſolently glory.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Breue</hi> alſo is prooued in this preface both by the date thereof, and otherwiſe that it was gotten by the information of the one part only, and how then could any controuerſie be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as it ought to be? for it beareth date 17. of <hi>August 1601,</hi> which was long before that the prieſts arriued at Rome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were there long before they were bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the proſecution of their appeale, as all men know, who know any thing in the common lawes, which allow two yeeres to the Appellants: <hi>and when his Holineſſe wrote the ſame</hi> (as though his Holineſſe wrote it) <hi>he had not vnderſtood</hi> (ſaith this author) <hi>of any of thoſe ſcandalous bookes written, and printed partly before, and partly ſince by our diſcontented brethren.</hi> If then he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake with the appellants, nor did ſee any of their bookes dedicated to himſelfe, or the holy office of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> by whom could he be informed in their affaires? or can any man of ſenſe imagine, but that there was moſt vnchriſtianlike dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that his Holineſſe muſt be perſwaded to ſhuffle vp mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo great moment in our Church, to whome were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the prieſts their appeale moſt euident proofes of the Ieſuites, and the Archprieſt their diſorders, in the managing of our Church affaires? And as for the ſtyle, in which his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is ſayd to haue written this latter <hi>Breue,</hi> we leaue it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſcan, who haue liſt thereto, and can vnderſtand how great the iniuries haue bene and are ſtill offred vnto Catholike Prieſts, without any one word of ſatisfaction to be made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them, who haue bene iniured: and let men of learning, who haue read, or hereafter may read the prieſts their bookes to his Holineſſe and the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> iudge whether it was not moſt neceſſary for the prieſts, to publiſh in their owne defence: and the prieſts will not be their owne Iudges, whether they haue done, or doe ſtill, as they may in conſcience doe, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:5209:183"/> vntill their fame be reſtored (which was vniuſtly taken away by the Ieſuites in their ſeditious treatiſe of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and the Archprieſt his pretended <hi>reſolution from Rome</hi>) and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie decided, which hath bene the cauſe of all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: for vntill this matter be fully ended, and the Catholikes ſatisfied, that the prieſts did as become Catholike prieſts to doe, there will be hope, that his Holineſſe will not debarre the prieſts of ſuch meanes as the lawe of Nature alloweth them, in the purging of themſelues of ſuch crimes, as their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence muſt needes argue a guiltineſſe in, and their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tell them, they muſt (vnder grieuous ſinne) free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from them. But marke I pray you, what deuiſes this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low doth vſe, to haue the prieſts forget the abuſes, which were offered vnto them by the Ieſuites, and their faction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for himſelfe</hi> (his Holineſſe) <hi>ſeeing that the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and offence and</hi> petra ſcandali <hi>(as it ſeemed) was about the name of</hi> ſchiſme <hi>and</hi> ſchiſmatikes, <hi>he is ſaide to haue taken that wholly away in this cauſe, both the matter, and name it ſelfe.</hi> See how he would haue his reader to thinke, that this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was about certaine <hi>names,</hi> as though there was neuer any <hi>reall ſchiſme</hi> laid to their charge. Were the Ieſuits ſuch blocks, as that they would for certaine <hi>names</hi> exclaime in this manner againſt the Secular prieſts, <hi>Harken, O ye factious, ye are rebels, ye are excommunicated, ye are fallen from the Church, ye are nothing better then Soothſayers and Idolaters, and as Ethnickes and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> beſides the terrours of <hi>eternall damnation?</hi> Were the Catholikes ſo barbarous, that for certaine <hi>names,</hi> they would in this time of perſecution thruſt Catholike prieſts out of their doores, and ſome with moſt impudent faces, ſome like eaues-droppers runne, or creepe about, to diſwade the Catholikes from harbouring them, or giuing them any maintenance? But let vs ſee how his Holineſſe is ſaid to take away the <hi>name, and matter it ſelfe,</hi> in this <hi>Breue:</hi> forſooth, <hi>forbidding any bookes, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, or writings to be made, read, or held thereof, and about that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie.</hi> This is a faire taking away of a matter: let vs then ſuppoſe, that there be no more bookes, treatiſes, or writings made, read, or held hereof, and about that controuerſie: I aske whether the Prieſts were <hi>ſchiſmatikas</hi> or no: or what is this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-prouidence,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:5209:183"/> or order to the purpoſe, for matters paſt? If the prieſts had bene as wickedly diſpoſed, as the Ieſuites, and had procured an infamy to haue runne farre and neere againſt them without iuſt cauſe, as this of <hi>Schiſme</hi> againſt the prieſtes hath bene prooued to haue bene moſt vniuſtly ſpread abroad, how could they thinke themſelues cleared of any ſuch ſlander only by an after-ſuppreſſing thereof? or how could they thinke that thereby any ſatisfaction were made vnto them? But glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would this authour haue it ſo, that the prieſtes being asked the cauſe of theſe preſent ſtirres, might be debarred of giuing the true cauſe thereof: for then might their aduerſaries iuſtly triumph againſt them as troubleſome people, and clamarous, and that they had buſied themſelues they knewe not why, or wherein. Had theſe Ieſuites, and their adherents halfe that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in them, which they would be thought to haue, they would not for very ſhame indent with their aduerſarie, that he muſt come to the field without his armes, and themſelues armed from the head to the foot: or were they men of that wiſedome, of which their followers take them to be, they wold neuer haue committed ſo great a folly, as to leaue no other hope of helpe for themſelues, then to procure that their aduerſarie muſt bee forbidden to pleade for himſelfe. If it be true (as their Libels will prooue it) that they accuſed Catholike prieſts of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> why ſhould any prieſt be afraid to ſay, that he was in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accuſed? And if for quietneſſe ſake the <hi>name</hi> muſt be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why for quietneſſe ſake ſhould not the courſe be altered, which was taken againſt Catholike prieſts, when the Catholike Laitie was in that manner ſeduced by the Ieſuites, to vſe that ſinfull name, when they named or ſpake of Catholike Prieſts? But it is no matter perchance, howe prieſts be abuſed by the new illuminated, ſo that they be not hereafter named <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,</hi> and therefore this authour profeſſeth, that he <hi>procured to auoid it in his</hi> Apologie, <hi>though not knowing of this expreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>indeede the thing it ſelfe did euer miſlike, and grieue vs.</hi> Weladay, weladay, what thing was that which miſliked and grieued you? was it the wickedneſſe which was committed in the ſlandering ſo many Catholike prieſtes, as would not (contrary to the Canons of holy Church, and vpon
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:5209:184"/> many iuſt reaſons) ſacrifice to an Idoll, who how well ſoeuer it was meant vnto him, by him who had authority, had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding no authority at that time, at which he challenged it, as hath bene euidently proued in the prieſts their bookes? did you euer <hi>miſlike</hi> that Catholike prieſts ſhould be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and diſpiſed by euery factious and ſeditious companion, who vpon hope of ſome gaine thereby, would fit your eares, yea and your hearts with a <hi>placebo,</hi> without any regard of them, to whom they owed loue, and duetie? harken I pray you, what it was, which miſliked, and grieued this fellow, <hi>that ſo much contention, and falling out ſhould be about a matter in the aire, where no man was named in particular.</hi> This then was it which grieued this good fellow, that the prieſts would not be called, and vſed like <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> but would proue themſelues to be Catholike prieſts, and to haue diſcharged themſelues in all points, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Catholike prieſts.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth very ſtrange, that <hi>Schiſme</hi> (againſt which there are ſo grieuous lawes in Gods Church, and againſt which <hi>F. Lyster</hi> the Ieſuit and his fellowes, the Archprieſt and all his faction inueyed ſo bitterly, and ſeduced the Laity in ſuch ſort, as they did as it were <hi>ſchiſmatically</hi> make a diuiſion in prayer, and communication, and Sacraments euen from their deareſt friends, and vſed themſelues moſt ingratefully toward their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fathers) ſhould now become no more then <hi>a matter in the aire, where</hi> (ſaith this fellow) <hi>no man was named in particuler.</hi> And this laſt clauſe happily is true: for that they were <hi>nickna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> and that <hi>in particuler,</hi> and not onely pointed at by euery one of the Ieſuits faction, but thruſt out of the houſes of thoſe Catholicks, who had drunke of the Ieſuits poyſon, and were <hi>particulerly</hi> alſo decyphered in that moſt wicked treatiſe of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> which was diuulged by the Ieſuits, the Archprieſt, and the reſt, as may appeare by that, which is ſaid in that treatiſe <hi>Paragraph 6 num. 10. Adextremum in ſuum ſempiternum dedecus legatos factioſos ad Pontificem factioſi isti deſtinarunt.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>At the laſt theſe factious haue to their eternall diſhonour ſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious ambaſſadors to the Pope.</hi> And in the next paragraph are the crimes of theſe <hi>factious</hi> ſet downe vnder this title, <hi>Factioſorum crimina, the crimes of the factious.</hi> Which are theſe, <hi>Ye are Rebels,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:5209:184"/> ye are ſchiſmaticks, and are fallen from the Church, and ſpouſe of Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> Prety names: and ſo he goeth forward with ſuch like; And can his reader thinke, that a Ieſuit would rage in this maner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an aduerſary <hi>in the aire?</hi> or that the particularities were not ſufficiently ſet downe, by which all men had notice who they were, that were held for <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> when the two prieſts were knowen, that were ſent to his Holines, and many of them who ſent them, or by whoſe conſent they went? Can any man thinke, that theſe fellowes had either wit, or honeſty, who would in action omit nothing, which might further the infamy or miſery of Catholicke prieſts, and in words pretend, that the matter was <hi>a matter in the aire,</hi> as here it is ſaid, or as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt affirmed in his letter to his Aſſiſtants the 23. of <hi>Iune 1601</hi> (againſt which letter <hi>the hope of peace</hi> was written) <hi>a matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and therefore not worthy to make a matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, which part ſoeuer was true?</hi> So doeth it pleaſe theſe new illuminated to oppreſſe their brethren, and to make a ſport of their miſeries, and moſt abſurdly condemne themſelues of want of al honeſty and charitie, who in a matter of ſo ſmall moment (as they doe make ſhew) would enter into ſo deſperate courſes, and trouble our otherwiſe too much afflicted Church. But ſince that <hi>the matter, and name of ſchiſme</hi> is taken away, I will not vſe it, but in ſuch caſe as of neceſſitie it muſt be vſed, and neceſſitie (as men ſay) is not ſubiect to any Law, neither can I thinke, that the prieſts being demanded the cauſe of their griefe, are forbidden by any <hi>Breue</hi> to ſay, that they were moſt vniuſtly both named, and vſed like <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> neither can their aduerſaries eaſily perſwade them vnto it, what holines ſoeuer they doe pretend, or ſtrict charge out of the <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt 1601,</hi> of which <hi>Breue</hi> this author, not hauing ſeene it, (as he pretendeth) vndertaketh to relate not only the contents, but alſo ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler ſentences, which he thinketh do make moſt for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and thus he goeth forward in his Preface.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:5209:185"/> whom it was made, after due deliberation hee admitteth it not, but wholly annulleth it.</hi> Here is one main point of the <hi>Breue,</hi> his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe hauing blamed the Archprieſt for his proceeding, as may appeare where theſe words are inſerted, <hi>Quod dolentes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferimus, which we relate</hi> (ſaith the Pope) <hi>with griefe,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not admit the Appeale (yet doth he not annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it) and if vpon perſwaſion of ſuch, as are loth to haue it proſecuted, he hath been induced to haue all matters ſlubbered vp, as once before they were; there is no doubt to be made, but when he ſhall haue heard both parts ſpeake (which is requiſite to all Chriſtian iuſtice) he will giue that ſatisfaction, which a tender father cannot deny to his oppreſſed children, who haue alwayes borne that honourable reſpect vnto that Apoſtolike Sea, that if an Archdeuill had bene appointed their ſuperiour, they would haue accommodated themſelues ſo farre, as they might, without diſhonouring God, betraying his Church, or preiudicing their owne ſelues, yet would they haue ſought (as now they haue done) with all ſubmiſſion for reliefe of the like miſeries, or greater, if they could haue bene ſubiect to greater. But the <hi>Breue</hi> being made (as here it is confeſſed) before his Hol. ſaw any of the prieſts their bookes, &amp; alſo before he heard the prieſts (as may appeare by the date thereof) it is no great marueile, that the <hi>Breue</hi> runneth in theſe termes it doth: yet is it ſomewhat ſtrange, and perchance neuer had any preſident, that the prieſts are commended who receiued the Archprieſt, before they did ſee the Popes letters, and that the other are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended or checked, theſe hauing done no other, then they were bound to doe by the lawes of holy Church, and thoſe other moſt contrary thereunto: for proofe whereof I thought it fitte to ſet downe the extrauagant of Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the eighth, which doth conuince as much as I haue ſayd. <hi>Iniunc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And whereas the prieſts are charged, that they publiſhed bookes, <hi>while the ſute hanged before his Holineſſe, without expecting his ſentence:</hi> reply is made, that the Archprieſt inforced them thereto by puniſhing the Appellants while the ſute hanged before his Holineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting his ſentence, and he puniſhed and afflicted them by reaſon of their appeale, as hath bene proued, and the <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt 1601.</hi> was procured againſt the prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:5209:189"/> that either they were come to folow their appeale, or their bookes in his Holineſſe hands, as here is confeſſed: ſo that his Holineſſe could not be informed by them of their caſe, how it ſtood with them, and their aduerſaries. And whereas alſo it is here ſaid, that the Archpr. was all this while their lawful Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Superiour, this Authour muſt finde how to ſatisfie all thoſe lawyers, who affirme that a Prelate pretending to haue an authoritie from the Sea Apoſtolike is an intruder, if he vſe his authority, without he ſhew his letters in confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the ſame Sea Apoſtolike, which it is euident the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt could not ſhew for a whole yeere after that he tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to play his prize againſt his fellow prieſts. During which time the prieſts had iuſt cauſe (as is ſhewed) not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, and after his confirmation hauing behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt ſinfully in his office, as it is determined by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and by his Hol. himſelfe (as appeareth by the copy of that conſultation, which was had the 20. of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 1602</hi>) his actions were iuſtly impugned, and this errour of the author of the <hi>Appendix</hi> ouerthrowen, where hee holdeth it of neceſſitie, that <hi>a lawfull ſuperiour cannot be impugned without offence to God.</hi> For theſe are his words in this Preface: <hi>It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth we ſay firſt that our good Archprieſt during all this time of tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation againſt him, hath beene, and is our lawfull Eccleſiaſticall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and conſequently, that ſo violent impugning him muſt needs haue bene very offenſiue to God, and perilous to the impugners.</hi> Can this fellow be any other then a limme of thoſe, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Council of <hi>Conſtance, Seſſ. 15.</hi> for maintaining <hi>neminem gerere vicem Petri, vel Chriſti, niſi illum ſequatur in mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or <hi>nullum eſſe Dominum ſpiritualem, dum eſt in peccato mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali?</hi> This fellow muſt ſhew how without maintaining theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors he can make his conſequent good: <hi>A lawfull ſuperiour is impugned,</hi> ergo <hi>it must needs be that God is thereby offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Corollary, which this author draweth, is that the books againſt which he writeth are forbidden by this <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt 1601. becauſe they treat expreſly, and principally euery where the matter of ſchiſme.</hi> The procurers of this <hi>Breue</hi> are noted herein to haue ſhewed a little ſubtiltie, but neither wit, nor honeſtie: For how can they imagine that Catholicke
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:5209:189"/> bookes written in the defence of Catholicks, who were moſt ſinfully ſlandered as <hi>ſchiſmaticks</hi> by the Ieſuits, and their ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adherents, can be iuſtly forbidden to be read, or kept, the ſlanderers remayning vncorrected for their wickednes, and no way abridged of their ſinfull courſes againſt the ſame Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prieſts? For in the ſame <hi>Breue</hi> all the charge which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is giuen to the Secular prieſts, and they who were the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious brochers of that ſinfull ſlander of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prieſts (yea although there be mention of their treatiſe of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> againſt the ſame prieſts) are not once named, as a part in the controuerſie, but are at libertie to abuſe the prieſts aſmuch as euer before.</p>
               <p>By this the abſurditie of the <hi>Appendix-maker</hi> appeareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in ſo often obtruding to his reader, that all matters are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and determined by his Holines, who neuer had ſeene the prieſts their bookes, nor heard them, what they had to ſay: neither can this author ſhew out of that <hi>Breue,</hi> that it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or determined by his Holines, whether the prieſts (who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cannons of holy Church, refuſed to admit a Prelate inſtituted, as is pretended by the See Apoſtolicke, but had no letter to ſhew for his inſtitution from that See) were <hi>ſchiſmaticks</hi> or no. Neither can this fellow ſhew out of that <hi>Breue,</hi> that it is declared or determined, whether thoſe prieſts, who ſo refuſed that Prelate, were for that cauſe <hi>exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated,</hi> or loſt their faculties, or could looſe them, by defending their innocencie by any law or edict, which could be made by the Archpr. or at the will, and pleaſure of a Prelate, who had his Authoritie not as an Ordinary, but as Sub-delegate, to whom was preſcribed a ſet forme of proceeding, in the inflicting of ſuch penalties, as he had power to inflict vpon thoſe, who ſhould deſerue them. In fine it appeareth not in that <hi>Breue,</hi> that the chiefe doers in this controuerſie are once named, or their facts cenſured: only a booke of theirs is ſuppreſſed, to wit, their <hi>treatiſe of ſchiſme,</hi> but not condemned, as falſe, or erronious, whereby any iudgement might be made, whether the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were iuſt, or not iuſt, or how the Catholicks, who were moſt violently caried againſt the prieſts, might be reſolued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point in controuerſie: yet is not this fellow aſhamed to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:5209:190"/> publiſh it vnto the world in this maner. <hi>So as now thoſe matters being thus declared, &amp; determined by his Holines, we hope that euery good Catholicke man, and eſpecially our brethren, that are alſo Gods Prieſts, will enter into themſelues, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like boldneſſe doth this Author vſe, and libertie in the next ſentence, where he wiſheth the good Catholike man, and eſpecially his brethren, to ponder well the <hi>abſurditie of ſpirit, and ſpeech proceeding thereof diſcouered in thoſe their later bookes, beyond all meaſure vnfitting for men of our vocation:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the booke to the Inquiſition,</hi> and <hi>The hope of peace,</hi> againſt which two bookes this <hi>Appendix</hi> is written, and becauſe he will ſeeme to ſay nothing, but what he meaneth to proue; <hi>this anſwer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall principally conſiſt in laying before them their owne ſayings in theſe bookes, with a word, or two of aduertiſement, to make more deepe, and full reflexion thereof.</hi> Now then it reſteth that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme aſmuch, and that he deale, both honeſtly, in relating the words out of theſe bookes, and charitably in giuing his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe later bookes, which he taxeth <hi>for abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit, and ſpeech,</hi> is intituled, <hi>The hope of peace, by laying open ſuch doubts, and manifest vntrueths, as are diuulged by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt in his letter, or anſwere to the bookes, which were publiſhed by the priests.</hi> But before he toucheth it, he diſcouereth a little of his owne <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>ſpeech,</hi> which whether it be not more <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,</hi> then that, at which he carpeth, an indifferent Reader may iudge, while he chargeth his brethren (as he termeth them) with <hi>fond, &amp; paſsionate proceedings in theſe their diſtracted agonies.</hi> In this title are 5. things noted. Firſt that it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary meanes to make, or hope for peace, to impoſe on the Archprieſt and diuulge againſt him calumniations of ſo <hi>manifeſt vntrueths,</hi> which can neuer be prooued. Secondly, that the Archprieſt is here named by contempt <hi>without any reuerence,</hi> or <hi>reſpect</hi> at all. Thirdly, that there is mention of <hi>doubts,</hi> the Archprieſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no doubt in the points he touched in his letter. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Archprieſts letter is tearmed <hi>an anſwere</hi> to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two bookes. Fiftly, that they call themſelues the prieſts, <hi>being but a fewe diuided men frrom the reſt, whoſe doings are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſliked and deteſted by the better and greater part of our Clergie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:5209:190"/>
               <p>To the firſt, replie is made, that it is the moſt ordinary and ſureſt meanes to make, or hope peace, to open doubts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethes, which is perfourmed in <hi>The hope of peace,</hi> without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any thing vpon the Archprieſt but what is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and this author himſelfe thought ſo well of thoſe meanes himſelfe, as in the preface he tooke occaſion to hope, <hi>reſt, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, peace, and obedience:</hi> becauſe as he ſayd, <hi>theſe matters were declared, and determined by his Holineſſe,</hi> and there is no man can doubt, but that the cauſe of this ſecond diuiſion was the not laying open of ſuch <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>manifeſt vntrueths</hi> about the ſlander of <hi>ſchiſme:</hi> which if it had been determined, when the firſt <hi>Breue</hi> came, thoſe wicked proceedings of the Archprieſt and his ſeditious adherents had neuer miniſtred any occaſion to make a ſecond <hi>Breue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſecond there is this reply made, that if theſe words, <hi>the Archpr.</hi> imply a contempt, then he is very often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptuouſly vſed by the author of this <hi>Appendix</hi> both in the preface, and the diſcourſe, where we reade the ſaid words, <hi>The Archprieſt,</hi> yea ſometime concerning the Pope himſelfe, <hi>the Popes Breue, the Popes authoritie:</hi> and where ſpeech is of the <hi>Prouinciall,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> of the Ieſuits fol. 17. <hi>Fa Parſons</hi> letter is cited, wherein there is no more <hi>reuerence,</hi> and <hi>reſpect,</hi> then this, <hi>the Prouinciall and Generall themſelues,</hi> which who will dare to ſay are named by contempt?</p>
               <p>To the third, replie is made, that although to men of ſenſe there is nothing in the Archprieſts letter, which ſhould moue any <hi>doubt,</hi> yet the letter being caried about, and preſented to the ſimpler ſort, there are many things which might mooue <hi>doubts</hi> in them, and particularly in the very firſt beginning the Archprieſt doth ſhew ſome doubt, where he ſayth, (ſpeaking of the bookes) <hi>perhaps neuer meant to bee preſented to him,</hi> (his Holines) And the fourth principall point which he toucheth, is touched as a matter in doubt, <hi>for it is</hi> (ſayth he, ſpeaking of the ſuppoſed <hi>ſchiſme</hi>) <hi>but a matter of opinion, and therefore not worthy to make a matter of contention, which part ſoeuer was true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth I anſwere, that the Archprieſts letter is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely called <hi>an anſwere</hi> to the bookes, but <hi>a letter, or anſwere,</hi> as may be ſeen in the title of the booke: but if it had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:5209:191"/> 
                  <hi>an anſwere,</hi> it was ſo chriſtned before this booke was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the Archprieſt himſelfe vſeth the ſame word: for not farre from the beginning of his letter thus we reade, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>no other anſwere ſhall be ſent now but this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fifth I anſwere, that they vſed the name of prieſts, to diſtinguiſh betweene the Ieſuits and them, the controuerſie being principally betweene them, as may appeare by the groundworke of all this controuerſie, to wit, the ſlanderous tongues, and pennes of the Ieſuits in the infamie of <hi>ſchiſme.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the controuerſie ſhall be ſayd to be onely among the prieſts, the name of prieſts will moſt fitly be applyed to them, who haue behaued themſelues as became prieſts, and the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the number can be no barre vnto them, howſoeuer their doings are <hi>miſliked, and deteſted by the greater part of the Clergie,</hi> which part, if it were the author of this Appendix (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth content to beare the name) it might with more humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie haue left out theſe wordes, ſpeaking of themſelues, <hi>the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that he hath canuaſſed the title of the booke, hee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canteth vpon the Scripture, which is prefixed vnto it, <hi>Verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tantum, &amp; pacem diligite:</hi> that is, <hi>trueth onely and peace doe you loue:</hi> and he telleth his Reader, that the prieſts do impugne peace and trueth: and this latter point hee prooueth, becauſe the booke is ſaid to be <hi>imprinted at</hi> Frankfort <hi>by the heires of D.</hi> Turner: whereas (ſayth he) <hi>the booke is knowen to haue bene prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at</hi> London <hi>by the fauour of the Biſhop, and permiſsion of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuants.</hi> This argument hath beene often ſolued before, and the folly thereof diſcouered, it being an vſuall matter among ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men (if <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> may be counted an honeſt man) to ſet out bookes as printed in one place, which are printed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the thing it ſelfe neither being of that qualitie, that it can induce any man into error, and no iuſt cauſe wanting, why ſuch a point ſhould be concealed. It was neuer heard of, before <hi>the abſurditie of this ſpirit</hi> appeared, that ſuch exceptions were taken againſt a booke. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did in a manner date his firſt Epiſtle from <hi>Babylon: Salutat vos Eccleſia, quae est in Babylone: the Church</hi> (ſayth he ending his Epiſtle) <hi>which is in Babylon ſaluteth you:</hi> and no man doubteth, but that he was then in Rome, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:5209:191"/> meant no other then to write from Rome. And ſhall wee ſay, that hee gloried in vttering an vntrueth? But whereas this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low affirmeth, that this booke was printed in <hi>London by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Biſhop and permiſsion of his Purſeuants:</hi> he diſcouereth that, which was neuer known vnto him, who paid for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, as I haue beene before very credibly informed. But to let paſſe theſe friuolous toyes and fooliſh exceptions, which might be quitted with a reall falſhood, commonly vſed by the author of this <hi>Appendix</hi> in publiſhing his libels, vnder the name of the vnited prieſts, who poore fooles muſt beare all the blame thereof, and runne thereby into perpetuall infamie, I will ſhew what exceptions this abſurd fellow taketh at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the booke, which he impugneth.</p>
               <p>Out of the Preface hee hath picked a fewe ſentences, out of which hee gathereth certaine notes worthy himſelfe: as firſt, that they are called <hi>the prieſts, as if they were either far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, or the moſt eminent prieſts of all England.</hi> Secondly, that they affirme, how that they haue ſet foorth two bookes in the neceſſarie defence of their good name and fame, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie he affirmeth to be no other, then <hi>the force of their owne paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and telleth a tale of King <hi>Edward</hi> (as he ſayth) or <hi>ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer King.</hi> Thirdly he noteth a comicall veine in the beginning of the Preface, and that the prieſts doe deſcrie a ſtage ſpirit, by mentioning <hi>fooles and phyſicians,</hi> and <hi>morning and euening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> which hee affirmeth that they did vſe, when they were vnder the Ieſuits. Fourthly he noteth more of this kind, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled alſo with ſome ſauour of <hi>impietie</hi> in theſe words of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. <hi>The Ieſuits might haue played with their Canons, vpon ſuch as reſiſted the Apoſtolicall decrees, &amp;c. And a little after Fa.</hi> Lyſter <hi>being alwayes ready with his Canon</hi> nullifas eſt, &amp;c. <hi>Here loe, who ſeeth not, that theſe men</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>by ſcoffing at Canons (which are nothing els but Eccleſiaſticall rules) meane to liue vnder no rule at all, &amp;c.</hi> Fifthly hee noteth, that the ſame Fa <hi>Lyſter,</hi> who cited that Canon, <hi>read both Philoſophie and Diuinitie with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations in other countreys.</hi> Sixtly hee citeth a ſentence, of which he miſliketh both the ſtyle, and the phraſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt note or exception, ſufficient hath bene ſaid, and how that the greater part in a communitie may be
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:5209:192"/> miſlead, and the part which hath iuſtice for it, deſerueth the title of the whole, for that in Courts of conſcience and iuſtice, the faultie (although otherwiſe far exceeding in number) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted either the leſſer part, or no part at all, but onely as a faction againſt them, who haue the trueth on their ſides: which hath bene declared by the Cardinals of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and his Holines alſo to be with the leſſer part of the prieſts. To the ſecond exception it is replied, that no man of any ſenſe can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that the moſt impious ſlanders, which the Ieſuits, the Archpr. and their ſeditious adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts did raiſe againſt the prieſts were a great neceſſitie for the prieſts to ſet out their books, yea after their appeale was made vnto his Holines: becauſe theſe fellowes deſiſted not from their wickednes, but perſecuted the Appellants, and the more eagerly for this fact of their appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, labouring in all places to defame them, and abridging them of their charitie, as they call it, which otherwiſe ſuch of the Appellants, as either in priſon, or elſwhere are in want, were wont to receiue for their reliefe. And as for his tale of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, or <hi>ſome former King,</hi> it is not his fortune, as I thinke, to thriue with his tales. Firſt becauſe how commendable ſoeuer a touch of a comicall vaine may be in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or graue matters, yet it is abſurd in him who ſhall vſe it, and yet finde fault therewith in the very ſame matters, as this fellow doeth in his thirde exception which I haue noted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe his tales are returned vpon himſelfe much more fitly, then he deliuereth them againſt his aduerſary. He remembred a ſtory that <hi>is recorded in one of our ancient writers, either of King</hi> Edward <hi>the Confeſſor, or ſome former King who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complained vnto by a certaine woman with great vehemencie, that an other had called her skold, ſhe being conuented, and not able to proue it, ſhe was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to priſon, but ſhe replyed ſaying: well then I muſt to priſon not for that I haue ſpoken vntrueth, but onely for lacke of a witnes. Wherewith the king being mooued ſaide, In good ſcoth I thinke you haue reaſon, and that in this matter I may bee your witneſſe, for that this woman in accuſing you, and defending her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hath prooued her ſelfe a very skold in deed. Thus ſaide the King, and the parable needeth no great application: for mee thinke euery man will vnderſtand it, and our brethren are like to haue
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:5209:192"/> the ſame ſucceſſe in the ende, if wee bee not deceiued, which wee leaue to the euent, and triall.</hi> Thus farre the tale of the skold, and in the very next wordes he blameth a <hi>Comicall veine</hi> in ſo graue a ſubiect, as this is. But to the skold. This Authour leaueth <hi>the parable</hi> (as he termeth it) to euery man to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; and if it be not vnderſtood as he would it ſhould, he is to blame himſelfe, would propound ſuch <hi>parables,</hi> and would not expound them. This <hi>skold</hi> I take to be <hi>Fa. Lyſter the Ieſuit,</hi> and in him his fellow Ieſuits, and the Archpr. with his faction, who mainteined that <hi>treatiſe of ſchiſme,</hi> and infinite other ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wicked actions againſt the other prieſts, who being many wayes put to ſilence, as hauing their complaint by appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not admitted, and commanded not to name it, wherein they had bene moſt iniuriouſly ſlandered, do ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therein the woman, who could not proue the skolde to be a skolde. But if king <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, or any other king (if not ſo ſaint-like, yet not altogether ſenſeleſſe) would take that treatiſe <hi>Of ſchiſme,</hi> and attentiuely reade it, he cannot but ſee a ſingular preſident for all the skolds, which ſhould for euer after ſucceed.

But marke I pray you, what cauſe this fellow had, to except in theſe tearmes: theſe were the words againſt which the exception is taken, <hi>people of all profeſsions, fooles and phyſicians, make vp their morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning meditations with the moſt vnciuill tearmes, which they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe againſt them</hi> (the Prieſts.) The holy Ghoſt by the Prophet Dauid, vſed the like phraſe againſt the perſecutors of Chriſt, and his Church: <hi>Quare fremuerunt Gentes, &amp; populi meditati
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:5209:194"/> ſunt inania? why haue the Gentiles bene inraged, and the people me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated vaine things?</hi> by which it is euident that although ſome meditations may be good, and to good end, ſome may be moſt wicked, yea and wickedneſſe it ſelfe, as the holy Ghoſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the mouth of the ſame Prophet, <hi>iniquitatem meditatus eſt in cubili ſuo, he hath meditated wickedneſſe in his bed:</hi> and when morning and euening meditations were thus mentioned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy Ghoſt, nor any good ſpirit thought it <hi>a veine more fit for a ſtage,</hi> then any graue ſubiect.</p>
               <p>To the fourth I anſwere, that the Canons of holy Church were not ſcoffed at, as this fellow doth moſt malitiouſly inform his reader, but the Ieſuite was blamed for the euill applying thereof, as may be ſeene in the diſcourſe: and the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is giuen, for that the Canon, which he applieth againſt the prieſts, ſpeaketh onely of ſuch as doe not obey <hi>Apoſtolicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> and the queſtion or controuerſie betweene the Ieſuites and their adherents on the one part, and the other prieſts on the other part, was, whether they were bound to giue credite to a <hi>Cardinals letter,</hi> for their ſubiecting themſelues to one, who had nothing els to ſhew for the authority which he challenged. A man may admire an aſſe, when he ſeeth him vnder a huge burden, who yet will laugh heartily to ſee him take a harpe in his pawes, to play thereon, or ſing vnto it: and yet will another be very iuſtly iudged an aſſe, who will affirme, that this man laughed at the harpe, and not rather at the aſſe: yet wil he haue his reader to conceiue, that the prieſts did ſcoffe at the Canon, yea more then this, that <hi>hereby it is apparant that they meane to liue vnder no rule at all.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>aduertiſements,</hi> of which hee ſpake in the end of his preface, to make more deepe reflection of the ſayings in the prieſts bookes, by which he hath made knowen alſo the <hi>abſurditie of his owne ſpirit and ſpeech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fifth note it is replyed, that it was an euill turne for F. <hi>Liſter</hi> the Ieſuite, to come into England to expond the Canon law, or deſcant thereon, if he read Philoſophy, and Diuinitie with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations in other countreys: for I doubt that he hath ſo diſcredited himſelfe in taking <hi>a Cardinals letter</hi> for <hi>an Apoſtolicall decree,</hi> as euery man, who commended him for the other matters, will iudge that not onely he was franticke,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:5209:195"/> when he writ his treatiſe <hi>of Schiſme,</hi> but as many other alſo as did applaud it.</p>
               <p>To the ſixt note which he maketh, no other anſwere is to be giuen, then that it might pleaſe him to reade it ouer againe, and ſhew ſome particular matter which he iudgeth blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: for diuers ſober men haue read it ouer, and ouer, and they iudge the ſtyle and phraſe moſt meete for the matter, and the matter moſt neceſſary to be knowen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Appendix-maker</hi> hauing diſcouered how litle he had to ſay of the preface, <hi>to the hope of peace,</hi> now he commeth to the anſwere which was made to the Archprieſts letter, but firſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his reader, that the booke to his Holines, and the Engliſh booke, which were the cauſe of the Archprieſt his complaint, or aduertiſement, (as he ſaith) were <hi>inuectiue and ſcandalous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> and that the Engliſh booke conteined many <hi>temerarious, falſe, and ſcandalous propoſitions, as well in matter of doctrine, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the actions of Superiours,</hi> to all which anſwere hath beene made in the reply to the <hi>Apologie,</hi> the doctrine of the prieſts prooued Catholike, and the obſtinate mainteiners of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary declared to be no better then heretickes.</p>
               <p>In this anſwere to <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> the authour diſcouereth an egregious audaciouſneſſe, as well in making a ſhew, that he can anſwere that, which in very trueth cannot with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be anſwered, as alſo in threaning ouermuch kindnes vpon the prieſts in miſ-citing their words, and making them ſay that which they neuer ſaid: a ſilly ſhift, but neceſſarily to be vſed, when no other is left, to miniſter at the leaſt a ſuppoſed matter to make a booke, which falſhood being diſcouered, the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> is fully anſwered: for as appeareth by the preface, this <hi>his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſhall principally conſiſt in laying before the Prieſts, their owne ſayings, with a word or two of aduertiſement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fift leafe, where he beginneth to except againſt <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> he doth falſely tell his reader, that the name of <hi>a rocke</hi> was applied to the Archprieſt in this diſcourſe: for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſpeaketh of <hi>rockes</hi> in the Archprieſts letters, and not as if the Archprieſt were the <hi>rocke</hi> himſelfe, and becauſe <hi>Dauus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be inſtructed, what is ment by <hi>rockes,</hi> in <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> he is to vnderſtande that ſuch things are meant, as lie either
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:5209:195"/> openly, or more hidden in thoſe letters, in which the <hi>rockes</hi> are ſaid to be, as are in the Seas, vpon which ſhips are violently caried or doe runne infortunately, when either the ſtormes are too great, or the Pilot vnskilfull.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt leafe exception is taken againſt the application of Scripture which our Sauiour vſed, <hi>if any of you asketh bread of his father, will he giue him a ſtone?</hi> but here is not one word in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to that which was applyed, to wit, that <hi>M.

               <p>In the ſame ſixt leafe he threatneth the prieſts downe, that they ſhould ſay, and not deny, that the Archprieſt confeſſed, that the inſtructions, which he firſt ſhewed, as from Rome, were not made in Rome, but ſome in England, <hi>by vertue of thoſe, which came from Rome, giuing him authoritie to make particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or inſtructions, &amp;c.</hi> alas the goodman is much miſtaken, for the two prieſts here named, to wit, M. <hi>Collington</hi> and M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> (who will giue ouer the office of accuſers, and witneſſes, for which they are here challenged, to M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where this poore ſhift will not helpe him) neuer ſayd that M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> had ſuch a ſhift at that time, but being taken in the falſifying his inſtructions, or propounding other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in place of ſuch, as he ſaid were annected to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſimply confeſſed the fraude, adding that indeed ſome of them were of his owne making, and all this ſtory of <hi>a vertue from Rome,</hi> was deuiſed afterward and ſet out for a poore ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his former falſhood. For if he had had al the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the world, by vertue whereof hee might haue made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, yet was it a falſe tale, to ſay that inſtructions made in England were made in Rome, or annected to his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he pretended to haue receiued from Rome.</p>
               <p>In the 7. leafe this fellow raileth at <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> becauſe there are not other accuſations mentioned againſt the Archpr. as though the poore man had not ynough of one, and in this his <hi>abſurditie of ſpirit, and ſpeech,</hi> he telleth in a <hi>parentheſis</hi> a moſt egregious knowen fitten: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſeemeth they M.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:5209:196"/> to catch him in his words.</hi> And all the towne rung of it, that <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> had conuented <hi>M. Collington,</hi> and <hi>M.

Blackwels</hi> appointment, hunted vp and downe to bring <hi>M. Collington</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> vnto him, as after two dayes ſeeking he did: but the new illuminates muſt beleeue all things which this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vttereth. And this much for his <hi>parentheſis.</hi> Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the principall matter here handled, this fellow is as falſe in repeating it: For thus he telleth his tale, <hi>About an hereticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſaid to be vttered by him, in that he told them, that they could not appeale from him in ſome points.</hi> The prieſts haue affirmed, that <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> notwithſtanding that he was diuers times admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by <hi>M. Collington</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> of the danger thereof, perſiſted in this propoſition <hi>that the Prieſts could not appeale from him to the Sea Apoſtolick,</hi> and theſe wordes, <hi>in ſome points</hi> are foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in by this author, and kindneſſe threatned vpon the prieſts, that they ſhould ſay that hee ſaid ſo, whereas if he had, he had ſaid more then trueth, hauing no colour therefore, becauſe he had no cauſe ſubdelegated vnto him, nor he put in any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to iudge any matter, with this clauſe, <hi>Appelatione remota.</hi> But this helps to gall the new illuminated, as alſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible concluſion, <hi>and laying all other arguments, proofes, and probabilities aſide, will ponder onely but the difference betweene the accuſed, and the accuſer in this caſe, ſhall quickly ſatisfie himſelfe;</hi> for <hi>M. Collington</hi> and <hi>M. Charnocke</hi> were then knowen to be two honeſt prieſts, and <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> was but one at the moſt, and it will be apparantly knowen, that they haue patiently ſuffered much iniury, for their mainteyning a iuſt quarrell, and he will be conuinced to haue bene a long time an intruder, or an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and afterward an abuſer of his authoritie, when he had it, againſt them without iuſt cauſe, when they ſhalbe cleared from <hi>Schiſme, rebellion, and diſobedience,</hi> which he and his adherents haue moſt malitiouſly, if not ignorantly obiected, and cauſed them to be perſecuted therefore.</p>
               <p>In the ſame leafe this poore fellow inculcateth <hi>his Hol. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> of this authority, as though that were a conuincing argument, that there was trueth vſed either for the ſetting vp
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:5209:196"/> thereof, or the mainteyning of it, whereas it is well knowen to thoſe, who will know ought in theſe matters, that his Holines may be miſinformed, and thereupon do that, which may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward recalled, as no doubt this will be, which is vrged in the ſame leaſe, out of the ſecond <hi>Breue</hi> of the 17. of <hi>Auguſt 1601. Sanè veſtro ſuperiori vos ſubmittere, atque ei obedire debeatis,</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ought to haue ſubmitted your ſelues to your Superior, and to haue obeyed him. For as I haue before ſhewed, he was at that time no other then an intruder, vntill he had his confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Sea Apoſtolicke, and he was to be puniſhed for his audaciouſnes, and al who receiued him at that time, and ſince, the matter hauing bene examined by the Cardinals of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> 20. <hi>Iuly 1602,</hi> the prieſts are cleared from <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 8. leafe he citeth two ſentences out of the <hi>hope of peace</hi> which tend to this effect, that the teſtimony of one Cardinall, doeth not bind in conſcience to beleeue a thing preiudiciall to a third: but he anſwereth not one of thoſe authors, which are there cited for proofe hereof, pag. 32. and 33. He telleth alſo his reader that when the firſt <hi>Breue</hi> came, the prieſts ſeemed to accomodate themſelues for a time, yet ſoone after they brake forth againe, and fell to writing, and examining the ſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals letters, more then before, <hi>reiecting and diſcrediting the ſame with all maner of contempt, and ſo they doe now in theſe later Libels, as though his Holines had neuer allowed or confirmed them.</hi> But he concealeth the cauſe of his writing, which was the Ieſuits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing the ſlander of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and the Archpr. his furthering thereof with <hi>a reſolution</hi> pretended to come from <hi>Rome,</hi> to that purpoſe: which wickednes of theirs did driue the prieſts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſtate of the queſtion, as it was before the <hi>Breue</hi> came, and to proue that they were not <hi>Schiſmatickes</hi> in that time, in which they were falſly ſaid to haue bene ſuch, and in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were to abſtract from the Popes <hi>Breue,</hi> whoſe after comming could not make the former cauſe better, or worſe, except only in this reſpect, that it conuinced, that the Archpr. was an intruder, who would exerciſe any authoritie, to which he was elected, or deputed by the Sea Apoſtolicke, before he had his letters from the ſaid Sea in confirmation thereof. And
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:5209:197"/> it may appeare very euidently, becauſe in that <hi>Breue</hi> there are not any ſuch wordes, as the Ieſuits and Archprieſt doe often vrge, <hi>Valida ab initio,</hi> (that is) that theſe things concerning the authority <hi>were of for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the ninth leafe he citeth a ſentence out of the 34. page, out of the which he noteth <hi>a reſtraint of the protectors authoritie to the court of Rome,</hi> and alſo <hi>authoritie to demurre vpon the Popes letters:</hi> for the firſt (ſayth he) they ſay that the office of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſtretcheth not it ſelfe any further, then <hi>the Court of Rome,</hi> which they prooue by the wordes of the Popes <hi>Breue,</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Nationis Anglicanae apud nos &amp; Apoſtolicam ſedem Protector:</hi> that is, <hi>Protector of the Engliſh Nation with vs, and with the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And to helpe the matter they doe adde of their owne, in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation, the word</hi> Here <hi>which is not in the Latine, to the end it may ſeeme to tie the</hi> Protectors <hi>office to the place it ſelfe, which is moſt abſurd to any man, that will conſider the meaning of theſe words, which is, that the</hi> Protectors <hi>office is giuen, ouer any nation, order of religion, or the like to protect, or defend them in all occaſions with his Holineſſe, and his ſucceſſors, vnderſtood by the words, Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike, whether it be in the Court of Rome, or out of Rome: for when the Pope lay at</hi> Auignon <hi>in France (for examples ſake) yet was the office of Protector alſo in vſe. And when Cardinall</hi> Caietane <hi>our late</hi> Protector <hi>was Legate in</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Polonia, <hi>his office of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip ceaſed not whenſoeuer hee would deale in any matter &amp;c. and this is ſufficent for this firſt point, which ſeemeth to include both folly, and audacitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſtory were firſt to be anſwered, why <hi>apud nos</hi> is thus tranſlated, <hi>Here with vs:</hi> But I wil leaue this to Grammer boies, who know that this word <hi>apud</hi> doth import a place conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the very nature of the ſignification, and as I thinke neuer vntill this day was this tranſlation iudged faultie, <hi>eſt apud me, he is here with me:</hi> or <hi>eſt apud illum, hee is there with him:</hi> and it cannot but argue a greater will in the <hi>Appendix-maker,</hi> then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to finde a fault. The reſt of the ſtory is as abſurd: for who did euer ſay, that a <hi>Protector</hi> did leaue his office when he was out
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:5209:197"/> of Rome? the prieſts words are, that <hi>it did not ſtretch further then the Court of Rome,</hi> which are true, although the protector be in <hi>Polonia:</hi> for although hee be there in perſon, yet may hee deale by letters in the Court of Rome, and at Rome, and all this while, although the man who hath authority be farre from Rome, yet his authoritie in that kind ſtretcheth it ſelfe to deale no further then in the Court of Rome. And put the caſe that the Pope ſhould goe againe to <hi>Auignon,</hi> and come no more at Rome, this fellow will not denie, that he remaineth ſtill Biſhop of Rome, and that as Biſhop of that Sea hee gouerneth the Church, and conſequently there muſt be the Court of Rome, and not in Rome, for that (as I take it) the Court is where the prince is, and this way alſo are the words true, which were vſed that <hi>the Protectors office, ſtretched not it ſelfe any further then the Court of Rome,</hi> whereſoeuer that Court is kept. And this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for to ſhew the <hi>folly and audacitie</hi> of the <hi>Appendix-maker,</hi> who would take vpon him to correct what it ſeemeth he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not. <hi>In hoc Conſiſtorio &amp;c. In this Conſiſtory,</hi> (that is the College of Cardinals, or the Popes Counſel ſaith, <hi>Zechi de ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Illuſt. D. Card.

                  <hi>And for the ſecond</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>about demurring vpon his Holines letters, we iudge it to be of much more importance, and far more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous, yea temerarious doctrine: for if it be lawfull for any man, as our brethren here auerre, to demurre vpon his Holineſſe letters, with minde to giue a reaſonable cauſe thereof afterwards; what end will there be of ſtrife? what obedience? what reſignation of willes, and iudgements to our Superiours commandements? &amp;c.</hi> See how this ignorant companion vrgeth it, as <hi>perillous and temerarius do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> notwithſtanding he was ſhewed in <hi>The hope of peace,</hi> that it was moſt Catholike doctrine, and according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of holy Church, and he was referred for his learning to the order of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, <hi>Cap. Siquando de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptis,</hi> where the Pope writeth in this manner to the Biſhop of <hi>Rauenna, Si quando, &amp;c. If at any time we direct any thing to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:5209:198"/> your brotherhood, which may ſeeme to exaſperate your minde, you ought not to be troubled;</hi> and afterward, <hi>hauing conſidered vpon the qualitie of that buſineſſe for which you are written vnto, either reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently fulfill our commandement, or ſignifie ſome reaſonable cauſe by your letters, why you cannot fulfill it, for we will beare it patiently, if you ſhall not doe that which hath been, or ſhall be ſuggeſted vnto vs by euil inſinuation.</hi> There is in the ſame place another ſaying of the ſame Pope cited, <hi>Cap. Cùm teneamur de prebendis, &amp; dignit.</hi> to the ſame effect, and this poore fellow not being able to make any anſwere hereunto, telleth his <hi>blind obedient</hi> a tale of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as though this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> had exhorted men to <hi>diſobedience,</hi> when hee told them, that they ſhould giue him a cauſe by their letters, why they did not or could not do as they were commanded by him.</p>
               <p>In the eleuenth leafe for want of matter, <hi>in the hope of peace,</hi> he falleth into the <hi>Copies of diſcourſes,</hi> and according to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious vaine, in which he was in the <hi>Apologie,</hi> hee excepteth againſt that, which is ſaid by the Prieſts, <hi>that authoritie is not an infallible rule of trueth in all who haue authoritie,</hi> and out of that which is ſaid, that <hi>but one vpon earth is warranted from error, and not he in all things.</hi> And hereupon he inferreth thus: <hi>how</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>can our Engliſh people aſſure themſelues, but that this inſtitution of the Archprieſt was one of the things wherein he might erre?</hi> By what Law, Logicke, or Diuinitie can this fellow ſhew, that his Holines cannot vpon falſe information doe a greater matter, then the confirmation of an Archprieſt, in the authoritie of an Archprieſt? It was woont to be no <hi>temerarious or perilous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> to affirme, that a Pope could commit a ſinne, which is a greater matter, then not to be well aduiſed in the inſtitution of an Archprieſt: for the ſinne groweth of frailtie in the man: and euill aduiſe or information, by which the Archprieſt is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his office, may come from another, in whome his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may repoſe a truſt, and be deceiued. All the reſt, which followeth in this eleuenth leaſe, is often anſwered in the prieſts bookes, and lately more at large by M. Doctor <hi>Ely,</hi> in his notes vpon the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and by M. <hi>Collington</hi> in <hi>his iuſt</hi> defence, &amp;c. and there is a reaſon giuen in the place, quoted in the 11. leafe, of that which is there brought out of <hi>the hope of peace.</hi> And the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:5209:198"/> fault or diſgrace (which this fellow would ſhould light vpon his Holineſſe concerning the inſtitution of the Archprieſt in that manner that it was) the Prieſts haue alwayes layd vpon the informers, who procured ſuch dealing as was, in a matter of ſo great moment: neither haue the prieſts challenged the ordination at any time for a matter of plot, as proceeding from his Holineſſe, but as it proceeded from the Ieſuits, who were known to attend principally to ſuch matters, and were the ſole actors in making this ordination, and moderating thereof, as hath more apparantly ſince beene ſeene: and at the very firſt they did ſo groſſely intereſſe themſelues therein, as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt muſt needs haue one of his inſtructions, not to doe any thing of moment without the aduiſe of the Superiour of the Ieſuits here in England. Although now in a conſult in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> it is adiudged to be taken away, notwithſtanding his Holines former confirmation thereof in the firſt <hi>Breue</hi> the 6. of <hi>April 1599.</hi> which alſo conuinceth, that his Holineſſe may doe that, which without offence may afterward be vndone.</p>
               <p>In the thirteenth leafe this author repeateth more matter out of the <hi>Copies of diſcourſes:</hi> for <hi>the hope of peace</hi> miniſtreth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matter for him to ſpeake againſt, and the booke to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition much leſſe, as it ſhould ſeeme by this <hi>Appendix:</hi> but it is ſufficient that there is a pamphlet intituled, <hi>An Appendix for the examination of theſe two bookes,</hi> it skilleth not how little ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is handled therein: but let vs ſee what this geare is. <hi>They adde</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>in the ſame page, that by the opinion of diuers men of iudgement in the lawes of our countrey, this our caſe may and will be drawen within the compaſſe of the law of</hi> Praemunire, <hi>loe here theſe men ſeeme to be counſellers that can ſay it may, and will be drawen, for that perchance themſelues had ſuggested it againſt other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes.</hi> But doe yee marke the reaſon <hi>why it may and will be ſo drawen?</hi> becauſe, ſay they, <hi>it is an externall iuriſdiction, brought into the real me againſt the will and notice of the prince and countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe you not ſee his Holines Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction wholly here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by theſe good men, as externall, vnleſſe it be allowed by the prince or countrey, notwithſtanding any difference in religion? And doe we marueile, that theſe men are fauoured by the Counſel, that will publiſh ſuch things in their be halfe againſt their owne religion?</hi>

               <p>A marueilous ſtory, and ſtoutly vrged. If the holy Ghoſt himſelfe ſhould ſay as once he ſayd by the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it inſipiens in corde ſuo non eſt Deus: The foole ſaid in his heart there is no God:</hi> would this companion chalenge the holy Ghoſt, that he ſaid <hi>there is no God?</hi> yet is it true, that theſe words proceeded from him, but not proceeding from him as his wordes, but as the words of a foole related by him, they might well be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken euen by God himſelfe. The like caſe is this of the prieſts, who affirmed in this place, quoted by this Author, no other matter then this, <hi>By the opinions of diuers men of iudgement in the lawes of our countrey, this our caſe may and will be drawen within the compaſſe of an old law, enacted as well by our Catholicke Biſhops and Prelates, as by the Prince, aboue 300. yeres agoe, viz. the law of</hi> Praemunire. Is here any aſſertion of the prieſts, <hi>that it may and will be drawen? &amp;c.</hi> Haue they not deliuered it in as plaine termes as they may, that it was the opinion of other men? they then are the counſellers, and not the prieſts, who onely haue related what they ſaid, and this poore fellow ſheweth, that his wits were ſmall in this deuice, and that his honeſtie was much leſſe, in that which followeth, <hi>for that perchance themſelues had ſuggeſted it, againſt other Catholickes.</hi> Is this a matter of ſo little weight, as it may be publiſhed at a venture? Is the fame of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike prieſts no more to be regarded, but to haue ſuch ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes caſt abroad againſt them? The new illuminated may ſee if they will, in whoſe pawes they haue put their ſoules, and what ſpitefull guides they haue choſen in place of their ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But concerning this lawe of <hi>Praemunire</hi> mentioned by thoſe, whoſe words or opinions the prieſts did onely alledge, there is enough ſaid in the reply to the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Apologie:</hi> here onely is to be noted, what this author hath ſince manifeſted in a late libell, commonly called, <hi>The manifeſtation of ſpirits,</hi> concerning this ſtatute: <hi>Wherfore</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being in thoſe dayes, about the collation of benefices and Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks in England, whereof the Popes were wont to diſpoſe for the moſt part, they concluded in England, after many contentions and diſputes, and many ſendings forth, and backe to</hi> Auignon <hi>in Fraunce, where the Popes at that time reſided, that ſuch prouiſions of benefices ſhould not be ſought, nor made from the Pope immediatly, for the time to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:5209:199"/> come, but onely in England, by conſent of the Prince, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afterward of the Pope, for the most principall benefices and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and whoſoeuer ſhould contrary to this, procure prouiſions imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from the Pope, or any other power or iuriſdiction, contrary to this law, ſhould incurre the penalties thereof. And this to haue beene the onely true meaning and intent of the ſaid law, and law-makers that were Catholickes, is euident by all authors, that haue written thereof. And in this ſenſe there is no controuerſie among vs, for that latter Popes haue either agreed thereunto, or permitted the ſame: and we ſee the like in vſe alſo in other Catholicke countreys at this day, by agreement and compoſition betweene the Sea Apoſtolike, Princes, and Catholike Cleargie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can the prieſts themſelues giue a plainer teſtimony for confirmation of the Lawyers their opinions by them cited? <hi>But</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>in this ſence there is no controuerſie among vs.</hi> In what ſenſe then is the controuerſie? forſooth <hi>beſide the ſenſe and meaning of the law, there hath bene another inuented by heretickes and enemies ſince that time, &amp;c. And in the ſame ſenſe and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, being plainely falſe and hereticall, as you doe ſee theſe libellers vrge it now againſt the Archprieſt and others, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If one and the ſame ſentence doe beare a Catholike and an hereticall ſenſe, it was wont to be iudged according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his diſpoſition who pronounced it: as for example this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Pater maior me est: my father is greater then I am,</hi> beeing ſpoken by a Catholicke was taken for Catholicke; but being ſpoken by an <hi>Arrian,</hi> was taken for hereticall. Such was the guiſe of Chriſtians before theſe new reformers appeared in the Chriſtian world: but now the world ſeemeth to be otherwiſe inſtructed, and Catholike prieſts how Catholikely ſoeuer they behaue themſelues either in words or actions, muſt be taken for <hi>hereticks, ſchiſmaticks,</hi> and ſuch like, at the diſcretion of ſuch, as whoſe actions (although they are moſt damnable, as was the writing, ſpreading, and approouing of that moſt impious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and other heatheniſh proceedings againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke prieſts) muſt be counted religious, and the authors to ſeeke nothing but the glory of God. And no man muſt ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, when the very ſtones in the ſtreet are ready to cry out of their wickednes, which they haue vſed againſt Cath prieſts.</p>

               <p>The other place noted in this ſame leaſe, out of <hi>the copies of diſcourſes,</hi> is there euidently ſeene to haue been ſpoken vpon iuſt cauſe, and this authour is not able to anſwere the reaſon there giuen: neither is it true, which here alſo he affirmeth, that the <hi>Breue</hi> of the ſixt of <hi>April</hi> is <hi>called in queſtion whether it were not forged:</hi> it is onely ſayd, that <hi>it was procured by Fa.</hi> Parſons, <hi>God knoweth out of what office:</hi> and the reaſon is there giuen of theſe ſpeaches, and it is further ſhewed in the Replie to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> how that his Holineſſe doth not ordinarily ſee the <hi>Breues,</hi> which he granteth.</p>
               <p>In the 14. and 15. leafe this author indeuoureth to ſatisfie his reader, why he doth <hi>often name &amp; inſinuate their</hi> (the prieſts) <hi>patrons, and their dealings with them in preiudice of Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and when he hath ſpoken his pleaſure, he ſolueth all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this manner. <hi>And albeit ſome perhaps may excuſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as though this coniunction were not directly to the hurt of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, yet euery man ſeeth, that by conſequence it is ſeeing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie is ſtrengthened by our owne diuiſion, and voluntary weakening of the Catholike party in their fauour.</hi> But perhaps an honeſt man will ſay, that this coniunction is neither directly, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the hurt of Catholike Religion, but rather the vniuſt proſecution of thoſe, who pretend to be Cath. through which <hi>hereſie</hi> may be ſtrengthened, and thoſe prieſts tyred, who haue and muſt deſerue beſt of the Catholike Religion. Neither is this any noueltie in Gods Church, that thoſe who ſhould bee nurſes of Gods people become cruel vnto them, and they who vſed cruelty, become pious in relieuing the needfull. S. <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> lamenting the deſolation of Ieruſalem, among other things breaketh out into theſe wordes: <hi>Sed &amp; lamiae nudauerunt mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam, &amp; lactauerunt catulos ſuos, filia populi mei crudelis, quaſi ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thio in deſerto. Thoſe creatures who were wont to teare their yong ones in pieces, prepared their teates and gaue them ſucke, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my people is cruel as an Oſtrich in the deſert.</hi> But to returne to our purpoſe: It is moſt true, that ſome prieſts haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued very great fauours of the Magiſtrates, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are of a contrary Religion hold it fit, that ſuch haue fauour, as they are well aſſured doe neither themſelues plot, nor combine with others, who haue manifeſted themſelues
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:5209:201"/> to plot againſt the temporall State, vnder a faire pretence of Religion, and in this ought theſe prieſts to thinke themſelues moſt deepely bound vnto them, for that they will take notice of their loyalty: and if M. <hi>Bluet,</hi> as here it is affirmed, haue layd the fault, where it ought to be, what reaſon hath this fellow to tell his Reader, <hi>that he will eaſily imagine that this fault is layd vpon the Ieſuits, and other, of their ſide?</hi> Maſter <hi>Bluet</hi> ſayd no ſuch thing, but perchance the matters haue been ſo groſſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by theſe fellowes, as no man can imagine other, and this fellow his guilty conſcience maketh him to vtter it, when the Ieſuites are not charged therewith. That which this fellowe carpeth at in the <hi>hope of peace</hi> pag. 13. &amp; 14. concerning the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of deuils, is plaine enough againſt him; the onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie is in his owne opinion of the Ieſuits, that hearing of the caſting out of deuils, he is ſtraight afraid of the Ieſuits, as thogh they were not onely deuils, but the onely deuils. That which is brought in, in <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> is brought to ſhew, that it is not vnlawful to take aſſiſtance in a good cauſe, euen of ſuch, as are otherwiſe contrary vnto vs. And therefore if there be any impietie in the application of the ſcripture there brought, the impietie is in this author, who placeth the Ieſuits in the deuils roome, and perchance he miſtaketh, when he affirmeth, that the Proteſtants haue them for Religions ſake, it being well knowen, that many of the Ieſuites friends are highly fauoured who are knowen not to differ one iot in religion from them, and the prieſts whom this author affirmeth to bee patronized by the Proteſtant magiſtrate, are true Catholike prieſts, and haue ſo ſhewed themſelues, and are reſolute to liue, and die in the Cath. religion: ſo that there muſt be ſome other cauſe of the hatred, if any be in the Proteſtant magiſtrats againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, then their religion. But ſee how he proceedeth: <hi>and they are ſo reſolute</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this holy doctrine, as they doubt not as it were to anathematize any man, that will not ſtand with them therein; for thus they write a litle after.</hi> Who doth not now expect ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence out of <hi>the hope of peace</hi> to this effect? yet when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it is of another matter, nothing appertaining to this, but here foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in by this author to ſerue his turne.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:5209:202"/> as this fellow expoundeth it, was cleane ended; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage of the Archpr. his letter taken to bee anſwered, where he writ in this maner. <hi>It cannot be liked of, that we ſhould write one againſt another &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon it being firſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what the Ieſuits writ againſt the prieſts namely in <hi>the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiſe of ſchiſme,</hi> and what infamy grew thereby vnto them, the neceſſity of writing on the prieſts ſide is prooued, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence here alleaged by this authour is vſed, to wit: <hi>And if the prieſts haue been compelled to this hard choice, as either they ſuſtaine infinite iniuries, and obloquies, or redeeme themſelues in this ſort,</hi> (that is by writing) <hi>from ſo vndeſerued an oppreſsion, no ſuperiour in the worlde can iuſtly finde himſelfe touched in credit, but ſuch whom the Apoſtle calleth</hi> principes, &amp; poteſtates mundi, rectores tenebrarum harum. This ſentence being in this ſenſe vſed by the prieſts, note I pray you how this companion draweth it to another matter. <hi>And is this true in deede good brethren</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that no Superiour in the world can thinke himſelfe touched in credit by this your dealing with heretickes against Catholickes, but that hee muſt needes bee accounted a prince of darkeneſſe? is there no exception at all with you? what if his Holineſſe that hath brought you vp &amp;c.</hi> And ſo hee goeth on in this vaine moſt idly, and cleane contrary to the intent and purpoſe of the ſentence which hee brought, as may bee ſeene in <hi>The hope of peace</hi> pag. 16. And yet after all this (which in his modeſtie he calleth, <hi>a malepart</hi> kinde of writing) he telleth his reader <hi>that ſome may excuſe the matter, as though this coniunction were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the hurt of the Catholicke Religion, yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Euery man ſeeth that by conſequence it is, ſeeing hereſie is ſtrengthened by our owne diuiſion.</hi> If this then be the matter, returne in Gods Name to vnitie, and doe that, which Chriſtians ought to doe in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God, and your iniured brethren, who by you, and your meanes haue ſuffred more indignities and affliction, then euer they had, or could haue of the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>In the 16 leafe he runneth ouer the reaſons, which are giuen for the prieſts their turning againe, after that they had bene often, and grieuouſly wounded by the Ieſuits, and the Archpr. and playeth his prize vpon this queſtion propoſed in <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> page 15. <hi>Is it to be thought, that Gods cauſe can ſuffer diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:5209:202"/> in any courſe, which is neceſſary for the recouery of his prieſts there honoured?</hi> But the point he ſtandeth vpon is the <hi>ſcandal,</hi> which may grow thereon, and chargeth the prieſts with a new diuinitie, as though they had neuer heard of the <hi>ſcandall of the Phariſes,</hi> which Chriſt himſelfe taught vs to contemne. That which this companion, and his fellowes ſhoote at is, to haue vs learne the diuinitie, which the aſſe had, who ſtarued to death leaſt by eating any thing which was neceſſary for his owne life, ſome other beaſt might haue miſſe thereof, and die after it. But himſelfe muſt haue libertie to write, and practiſe his pleaſure without any feare of <hi>ſcandall,</hi> for ſo he writeth in his Preface to the <hi>Apologie: which reſpect of ſcandall ſhould haue withheld vs whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from putting pen to paper in this caſe, if the intemperance of ſome perſons, &amp;c.</hi> Poſſibly this preacher would haue his audience do, as he ſaith, but not as he doeth, and this is a ſpeciall guids trick, but very farre different from the ſpirit of our Sauiour, and S. Paul whom here he citeth, as earneſt forwarners that no <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> be giuen.</p>
               <p>In the 17. leafe he citeth a place out of <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> where was proued, according to the Logicke, which ſome of the new illuminated had vſed, <hi>that all men, who had any trayning vp vnder any master, muſt ſubiect himſelfe to euery punie Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</hi> To which (to omit his falſhood in relating the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) he telleth his Reader, that our bond is greater to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, then temporall parents. And ſo with ſome of his modeſt termes he ſhuffleth vp the matter, as if this had bene the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or the point there handled, and not rather whether it be fit, that becauſe a man had once a Scholemaſter, hee muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ſubiect to euery puny Scholemaſter during his life. The place is to be ſeene in the <hi>hope of peace, pag. 18. &amp; 19.</hi> That which followeth in the 17. leafe concerning a letter of <hi>Fa. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> is fooliſhly anſwered: for (as there it may ſeeme) this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith no otherwiſe, then was before ſaide in the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which he excepteth.</p>
               <p>In the 18. leafe that which is affirmed of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> his brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of rules into the Engliſh Colledge at Rome contrary to his promiſe, is to be declared by them whom it concerneth, and were preſent when it was done, and are to be credited. The
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:5209:203"/> other matter concerning the new buildings, is here falſly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>as made by the Ieſuits, and namely</hi> Fa. Parſons; All which is foiſted in place of this, <hi>But they were not at the charge of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, but of the Colledge.</hi> A ſimple change, but all is to the glory of God: but would a wiſe man haue talked ſo vainely of new buildings in the Colledge <hi>by the Ieſuits, and namely</hi> Fa Parſons: and in the ſame place tell his reader of the want which the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had by the diſcontinuance of a monthly penſion, which they once had of Pope <hi>Gregory the 13?</hi> was it a time for <hi>the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and namely</hi> Fa. Parſons, to ſpend the reuenues of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making a larger Colledge, when for want of money there could not be ſcant halfe ſo many Students, as were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently accomodated, before theſe new buildings were made? Is this fellow in his right wits, that would thruſt ſuch a matter vpon <hi>the Ieſuits, and namely</hi> Fa. Parſons, to whoſe charge this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie was not layd in <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> as may be ſeene page 20. which place is here cited by this author?</p>
               <p>That which is affirmed in this 18. leafe out of <hi>the hope of peace</hi> concerning the Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> his diſlike of the Ieſuits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his latter end, and alſo that M. <hi>D. Haddocke</hi> affirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he had written to ſir <hi>Francis Inglefield</hi> into Spaine, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine confirmed. And if <hi>D. Haddocke</hi> wil deny that he ſaid it, he may mend in his honeſtie when he will: for what was written, was written from his owne mouth.</p>
               <p>In the 19. leafe there is a recapitulation made of that, which is ſaid in <hi>the hope of peace</hi> concerning the Seminaries erected in Spaine by the Ieſuits meanes, of which it was ſaide in reſpect that there were Seminaries ynow, &amp; the wants of many poore Catholicks were great, that the money imploied in thoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, might haue bene giuen with more merit to the reliefe of them; And this is heynouſly taken by this author, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhewed what extraordinary good hath come by thoſe Seminaries. That <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> entred into other mens labours is confirmed by the teſtimony of Ma. doctor <hi>Cecill,</hi> who and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Prieſt layd the firſt foundation thereof in Spaine; And as for the ſubſcribing to the title of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine blanckes: there are diuers prieſtes in England, and out of England can teſtifie it. And what is ſaid in <hi>the hope of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:5209:203"/> peace</hi> page 28. concerning the blotting out of an interrogatory made by <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> to M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> is moſt true, although this fellow doe falſifie the place, which he quoteth, for there is no ſuch matter in <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> as this fellow citeth, to wit, <hi>that D. Barret, D. Elie, and others were hindered by Fa. Parſons;</hi> but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this companion haue one falſe tricke or other, he feareth his pen will grow too ſoone out of vre.</p>
               <p>In the twentieth leafe this Authour groweth to an ende of his anſwere to <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> and willing to leaue a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance behind him of ſome notorious matter, hee telleth his Reader, that almoſt in euery other leafe of both Bookes, that is, as I conceiue, <hi>The hope of peace,</hi> and <hi>The copie of diſcourſes,</hi> (becauſe theſe onely are in Engliſh, the other two were in Latine) when the prieſts touch the inſtitution of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, they affirme, that it was nothing worth, <hi>for that it was procured vpon falſe, wicked, deuiliſh, and impious ſuggestion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betweene the Prieſts and Catholicks, whereas there was no ſuch indeed.</hi> And thus ſayth he, <hi>they repeate againe and againe without all modeſtie in euery place:</hi> but you muſt goe looke where: for I haue gone ouer both theſe bookes againe and againe, and I do not remember that this which hee hath alledged is in any one place of their bookes: and if any man be ſo well ſighted, as to find it in ſome one place, then ſhall not this author be vtterly condemned of want of all modeſtie or honeſtie. True it is, that ſurreption is often alledged, to make void the Popes graunt, which both according to the Canon lawes, and al interpreters thereof, doth alwayes ſuppoſe this clauſe: <hi>Si preces veritate ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>if the petition be grounded vpon truth,</hi> and no man of reaſon or learning euer taught the contrary, howſoeuer any lawe made by prince ſhould ſtand in force, although hee were induced thereunto by falſe motiues, and therefore is this compariſon faſely made here, and moſt ignorantly. And no leſſe falſe it is, which is here affirmed, that there was a <hi>diuiſion begun betweene Catholicke priests, and Religious men, as well for the matter of the pretended aſſociation, as alſo about the ſlandercus</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall <hi>fent ouer by</hi> Robert Fiſher: for ſo ſoone as the prieſts perceiued that ſome did diſlike of the aſſociation, they gaue ouer the ſoliciting it here in England, and this matter of the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:5209:204"/> 
                  <hi>Memoriall</hi> came too late from England to Rome (as is ſhewed in the reply to the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Apologie</hi>) to be a caſe of this ſubordination, but ſomewhat muſt be ſaid to patch vp a broken matter, and rather then faile, the religious men ſhall now be brought in, who were cleane out of the Card. <hi>Caietanes</hi> letter, as now we haue it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame 20. leafe, this author ſayth, that he <hi>will end with one tricke more of theirs, wherewith they end this booke: that is, that Fa.</hi> Garnet <hi>hauing written to them a letter, exhorting to peace, and telling them, that he doubted not but they ſought the glory of God, and conſequently would hearken to the meanes &amp;c. they now will needs take him at his word, &amp; threape vpon him, that he knoweth they ſeeke nothing but the glory of God in all theſe their actions and ſcandalous attempts: Fa.</hi> Garnet <hi>(ſay they) knoweth wee doe ſeeke the glory of God, and witneſſeth ſo much in his letter dated on</hi> Midſommer <hi>day laſt paſt. Loe here how ſubstantially they prooue by F.</hi> Garnets <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that they doe ſeeke the glory of God: euery child will laugh at this, and ſo we need to ſay no more of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt it is falſe, that Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> is ſaid to haue written vnto them: for his letters were to certaine other priſoners, to deale as it were betweene both parts. Secondly hee propoſed ſuch meanes, as hee himſelfe beſt liked, but were not indeede any meanes for peace. Thirdly, howſoeuer this fellow cauilleth, or commenteth vpon <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> there is nothing there cited, but what F. <hi>Garnets</hi> letter will beare: <hi>I know alſo</hi> (ſayth F. <hi>Garnet</hi>) <hi>that thoſe which complaine againſt vs doe deſire Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> but it is to be vnderſtood, according to the meaning of the Ieſuits (as it ſeemeth) who alwayes doe meane what they liſt, and euery childe may very well laugh at it, and hee who taketh hold of any thing which proceedeth from them, is as ſure as he is of the wet Eele which he hath by the taile: yet true it is, that thus the Ieſuite writ, but what meaning hee had, he ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound himſelfe, for ſo hee will whatſoeuer his words are: <hi>and ſo we need to ſay no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Appendix maker</hi> hauing ſcurried a little ouer <hi>the hope of peace,</hi> of which he would gladly haue bin diſcharged much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, runneth ouer the booke which is dedicated to the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which his labours there occurreth no new thing worth
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:5209:204"/> the noting. In this he ſpendeth almoſt foure leaues, &amp; the moſt part thereof is in gentle perſwaſions, yet can hee not ouerpaſſe Ma. <hi>Charnocks</hi> going into England contrary to the ſentence, wherein he was charged vnder mortall ſinne, not to goe (as he interpreteth the ſentence:) he telleth moreouer, how that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Burgheſe</hi> writ a letter vnto M. <hi>Charnocke while he was yet in France, diſſwading and condemning that fact, if he ſhould doe it, &amp;c.</hi> which the letter it ſelfe, and the <hi>Apologie</hi> alſo, fol. 156. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth of an egregious falſhood. Afterward hee telleth his Reader, that M. <hi>Charnocks</hi> reply was <hi>ſo irreuerent and malapert, as any modest man that ſhall read it, can but feele his eares burne in behalfe of ſo honorable and venerable a man, as the good Cardinal is:</hi> but there is not one of <hi>M. Charnocks</hi> reaſons anſwered, which doe iuſtifie his returne into England, notwithſtanding that ſentence, which was giuen in the letter of the two Cardinals, <hi>Caietane</hi> and <hi>Burgheſius:</hi> neither is it the faſhion for this fellow to anſwere the reaſons otherwiſe then as olde heretickes were wont, who when they had not what they could ſay againſt the Catholikes, they would breake into railing: and in the 24. this fellowe not knowing, in what particular to take exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the narration of the vſage of M. Do. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> at Rome, he telleth his reader, that <hi>they ſet it forth ſo tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as any acte euer done by</hi> Nero, Caligula, <hi>or</hi> Diocleſian. A good commendation for thoſe, who were the cauſe thereof, nothing being there ſet forth, but what was moſt true. Laſtly, there is a little ſomewhat in the defence of F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> of whom this authour cannot deſerue too much: but his actions haue ben too groſſe in the managing of this matter to be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or ſmothered vp. God ſend him his grace, that he may ſee his owne naughtineſſe in time, and ſaue his ſoule after ſo many deſperate aduentures, which alſo I heartily wiſh to them all, who haue either maliciouſly or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly run this wicked courſe againſt Catholike prieſts.</p>
